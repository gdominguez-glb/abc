<h1>GREAT MINDS PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>Last Updated: August 26, 2020</p>

<p>
Great Minds and Great Minds PBC (collectively, “Great Minds”) seek to ensure that all students, regardless of their circumstance, receive a content-rich education in the full range of the liberal arts and sciences, including English, mathematics, history, the arts, science, and foreign languages. Great Minds does this by working with teachers, scholars, and schools to create curricula and instructional materials, conduct research, and promote policies that support a comprehensive and high-quality education in America’s public schools.</p>

<p>We are so grateful that you have given Great Minds your trust and have chosen to join us in this crucial work; keeping your trust through the protection of your privacy is of utmost importance to us.</p>

<h2>VIII. OUR COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM STUDENTS</h2>

<p>
The Great Minds Website is not directed to children under age 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children through the website except as otherwise detailed herein and only then if we have a written agreement with the child’s, parent, school or school district allowing us to collect the same.</p>

<p>We collect the following types of personal information from children who use our educational products and services under the direction of a customer (each, a “student”). Our customer may be a school district, school, teacher, or parent: name; email address, grade in school; student, school, and district ids, information and content submitted (e.g., responses to questions, assessments, notes, video or voice recordings).</p>

<ul>
	Subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable law or our agreement with our customer, we use and disclose the personal information we collect from students:

<li>To personalize their experience;</li>
<li>To permit our customer and its authorized users, such as teachers and school administrators, to interact with students, review their work, provide feedback, monitor their progress, and tailor our products and services as appropriate;</li>
<li>For analytics purposes, so that we can understand how our curricula, products, and services are used and to develop and improve them;</li>
<li>To provide reports to our customer, such as about the progress of a particular school or class;</li>
<li>If a student’s school district chooses to have Great Minds manually roster a student so that a student may use Great Minds services, a student may receive an activation email from Great Minds along with an initial password and link to login to Great Minds’ platform or services. Additionally, students may receive emails should the student need to reset their password.</li>
<br>
We may also disclose a student’s personal information: (a) as directed by our customer to which the information relates; (b) to our third-party service providers, to permit them to provide services to us; (c) as we believe necessary or appropriate (i) to comply with legal process or to respond to requests from government authorities, or (ii) to protect our rights, safety, or property and/or that of our affiliates, our customers, our users, or others; (d) in connection with any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). For Great Minds’ student-facing platforms and services, Great Minds may use cookies but only to track user credential information else. This information is used to help diagnose login access issues, if needed.

</ul>

<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a student and you would like to request access to your child’s personal information, request its deletion, or refuse to permit further collection of it, please contact your child’s teacher, school, or school district.</p>
