I’m pleased to share with you our findings from a “Listening Tour” we conducted this fall. This tour, during which we visited school districts in four different states (Louisiana, New York, Arizona, and California), is the second in a series of tours we plan to continue, not only for <em>Eureka Math</em> users, but for those implementing our ELA and history curricula as well. A typical Listening Tour visit lasts about two days, and includes focus group discussions with teachers and administrators, classroom observation and debriefs, and a parent night. This fall, we visited 15 elementary, middle, and high schools, and listened to feedback from about 200 teachers, administrators, and parents</p>\n<p>The findings summarized here reinforce what we heard in our first Listening Tour in spring 2014. For example, teachers spoke to us about the need for collaboration and resource-sharing; we’re now launching a virtual community exchange that will allow <em>Eureka Math</em> users to network and share best practices. We also heard some new concerns, such as aligning assessments to state tests and the need for video footage of exemplary classrooms</p>\n<p>The feedback we receive during these tours helps us continually improve the curriculum, develop effective professional development, and create the right resources to support teachers. We are grateful to St. Charles Parish Public Schools, Deer Park School District, Yuma Elementary School District One, and Berkeley Unified School District for giving us this opportunity to listen.</p>\n<p>We’d also like to give all of our users a chance to voice their feedback.

Some teachers would change it up a little, but most were pretty close to:</p>\n<p>1. Understand the Problem\n2. Come up with a Plan for Solving\n3. Carry out the Plan\n4. Reflect or Check Your Work</p>\n<p>These steps are better known as <a href='http://teacher.scholastic.com/lessonrepro/lessonplans/steppro.htm' title='' rel=''><strong>Polya’s Problem Solving Approach</a> a</strong>nd were developed by George Polya in 1945. Although these steps always sounded like a good idea and did get students thinking through the math problems they were facing, they didn’t always get the job done</p>\n<p>What happens when you can’t get past step 1? You read the problem over and over and still can’t make sense of it. You listed out the known information, you underlined the key terms and circled the numbers, but you just can’t figure out what to do. Under this problem solving approach you are expecting students to understand the problem before making any drawings, diagrams, tables, patterns, etc., which can leave many students fumbling to make sense of it all.</p>\n<p>This is where the “Read, Draw, Write” (RDW) approach comes in to play. Here is the basic idea of this strategy:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>READ</strong> the problem. Read it over and over…. And then read it again</p>\n<p>2. <strong>DRAW</strong> a picture that represents the information given. During this step students ask themselves: Can I draw something from this information? What can I draw? What is the best model to show the information? What conclusions can I make from the drawing</p>\n<p>3. <strong>WRITE</strong> your conclusions based on the drawings. This can be in the form of a number sentence, an equation, or a statement</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*_PC25qOoHt4OpcRC7MXNXg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">This example is taken from Grade 3 Module 1 Lesson 1 in the Eureka Math free Module PDFs.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>What is so great about the RDW approach? Students are able to draw a model of what they are reading to help them understand the problem. In Polya’s approach, the drawing came after understanding. In this approach, the drawing helps lead to the understanding. Drawing a model helps students see which operation or operations are needed, what patterns might arise, and which models work and don’t work. Students must dive deeper into the problem by drawing models and determining which models are appropriate for the situation.</p>\n<p>While students are employing the RDW process they are using several Standards for Mathematical Practice and in some cases, all of them. Some of these would include: make sense of problems and persevere in solving them, model with mathematics, use appropriate tools strategically and look for and make use of structure.</p>\n<p>Do you use the RDW strategy?

Can we encourage a culture of practicing professionals where error is normalized and mistakes are opportunities for growth? Practice isn’t about perfection. It’s just about getting better.</p>\n<p>At a recent <em>Eureka Math </em>Institute for Leaders, I was personally challenged to practice a Fluency component of the curriculum with a colleague. As a curriculum writer for Eureka, this was uncomfortable. I wrote it. I should be able to deliver it. Flawlessly. As I looked around a room full of Type As, there was a sense of discomfort. Colleagues hesitantly paired off to practice, but nobody was itching for critical feedback. (Okay, maybe a few.</p>\n<p>And so I played the role of the teacher in the following Happy Counting Exercise:</p>\n<><strong>Happy Counting by Twos</strong> (3 minutes</>\n<>T: Let’s count by twos, starting at 0.

It was about me. My signal was sloppy. Quite frankly, it stank.</p>\n<p>My partner said, “Okay, I’m going to push you to work on your signal. I’m having trouble with the closed hand. Instead, when you are about to change direction, how about you turn your thumb just a little more slowly, so I have a second to make those adjustments, especially when counting back.”</p>\n<p>After his feedback, I called my shot. “This time I’m going to eliminate the closed hand and emphasize the shifts in counting by going slower. This will give you a split second to think.”</p>\n<p>We ran the sequence again. <em>Better.</em></p>\n<p>After affirming my efforts, he asked, “Can I give you another push? This time, try to really emphasize crossing the tens. Do a couple of ups and downs over 8 and 10 and 18 and 20.”</p>\n<p>I called my shot again, adjusted, and ran the sequence.</p>\n<p><em>So much better.</em> I have to admit, the deliberate practice felt good. The feedback was sincere, honest, and directly impacted my students’ success. This idea of pushing one another to our best practice is a paradigm shift that the <em>Eureka Math</em> community is embracing. Every day is a big game in the classroom, and while we usually don’t have the luxury of practicing each component of a lesson, this new shift in preparation is changing our effectiveness as teachers. Even 3 minutes of deliberate practice is time well spent.

144	8	How Bill Gates Predicted the iPad Pro	Should a tablet do everything your laptop does? Microsoft always said yes. Apple disagreed. Until now.	2015-09-09 22:55:59	c76ab3dfe96a	<h2>How Bill Gates Predicted the iPad Pro</h2>\n<h4>Should a tablet do everything your laptop does? Microsoft always said yes. Apple disagreed. Until now.</h4>\n<p></p>\n\n<p>In <strong>early 2001, Bill Gates</strong> summoned me to Redmond, Washington to view a product that he touted as the future of computing. It would be called the <a href='http://www.newsweek.com/bill-gates-says-take-tablet-150561' title='' rel=''>Microsoft Tablet</a>. Its DNA lay in Alan Kay’s legendary 1960’s Dynabook concept, a magic slab of screen and silicon that was never built. Microsoft had even hired Kay’s key co-workers at Xerox PARC, Butler Lampson and Chuck Thacker, to help birth this new device. I was impressed with the team and the idea. Gates himself felt he understood why tablets had not taken off to date</p>\n<>“They didn’t work, basically,” he said. “The hardware wasn’t good enough, the software wasn’t good enough, the batteries weren’t good enough, there was no wireless network.”</>\n<p>But what really startled me was Gates’ assertion that the tablet was not destined as a new product category, but something that would do everything a laptop would. All laptops, he told me, were destined to become tablets.</p>\n<p>The Microsoft Tablet, released in 2002, did not succeed. Some blamed its reliance on a stylus, which slid on the screen like a sneaker on a hockey rink. Others complained that Windows implementation did not fit well with the tablet format. Basically, though, the hardware wasn’t good enough, the software wasn’t good enough, the batteries weren’t good enough, and the wireless network was not yet pervasive.</p>\n<p>In any case, the category went dormant — until 2010, when Apple released the iPad. Apple’s success in part came from reimagining the tablet computer as something distinct from its desktop line. When Steve Jobs demo’ed it, he sat on an easy chair, with no desk or pedestal in sight.</p>\n<p>The iPad wouldn’t replace your laptop, but it would be a vital and delightful portal to media and information, powered by Apple’s mobile operating system. Jobs did demo some productivity software, hinting that you could indeed do work on your iPad. But the strength of this new gizmo was that it did not ape a laptop but was its own thing.</p>\n<p>The iPad was a hit. Even though its growth has slowed, Apple still sells millions.</p>\n<p>The iPad’s success was certainly a factor when Microsoft dove back into tablets in 2010. But despite Apple’s winning strategy of designing the iPad as a media and communications device, Microsoft still stuck to its original philosophy that a tablet should excel at business functions. You would use a Surface instead of a laptop. To make this possible, one of Surface’s innovations was a nifty plastic folding keyboard. After the first version flopped, Microsoft kept improving, and it now seems that the Surface is over the hump. (One sign of this: <a href='http://fortune.com/2015/09/08/dell-hewlett-packard-microsoft-surface-pro/' title='' rel=''>Dell and HP </a>have agreed to sell Surface devices through their channels, even though they make their own tablet computers.) But sales are still a fraction of iPad numbers</p>\n<p>That’s why on first glance it’s puzzling that Apple has chosen to revitalize its tablet business by introducing a new addition to its tablet family, the iPad Pro. Judging from the evidence of today’s keynote, Apple is embracing the Microsoft philosophy. The iPad Pro has a huge 12.9 inch screen, big as a Whoopee Cushion with the air leaked out. It’s 78 percent bigger than the iPad Air! That’s an interesting direction considering that the company did a lot of chest-beating a couple of years ago while touting the descriptively named iPad Mini. It’s going to be awesome to see movies on that screen. But more to the point, that screen is necessary to most effectively run the business applications that Apple sees people using with the iPad Pro.</p>\n<p>To make this happen, users will want to get two Apple accessories sold separately from the iPad, but vital for its use. The first is what the company describes as a Smart Keyboard. It cost $169, and though it has some ingenious aspects (particularly in a zipless connection to the iPad) it looks a lot like the Surface counterpoint. (An alternative is using a full-sized soft keyboard on the screen, but clearly the iPad Pro begs to be used propped up in the Smart Keyboard and ready for touch typing.)</p>\n<p>The second is — zounds — a stylus! That’s right, the Apple Pencil, at $99. On the one hand it isn’t fair to compare the Pencil to a traditional stylus, as it has advanced technology that allows for precision drawing. And its design virtuosity enables Jony Ive to gush for a few solid minutes in a video. But it’s still a separate gadget that you can lose in a couch cushion — one of the reasons that Steve Jobs once used to proclaim the stylus as wrongheaded and clunky. (“If you see a stylus, they blew it,” <a href='http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/08/jobs-if-you-see-a-stylus-or-a-task-manager-they-blew-it/' title='' rel=''>he once said</a>.) But in demos, Apple showed how using its pencil in drawing and productivity applications could make the iPad Pro perform tasks that you couldn’t do on previous iPads</p>\n<p>One handicap Apple has in pursuing its productivity strategy is the lack of a great in-house set of basic business applications. To address this, the company offered a surprising solution: the gold standard of applications software, Microsoft’s Office suite. In a reprise of the “hell freezes over” moment in the 1997 Macworld keynote — the one where Steve Jobs announced an alliance with Microsoft in order to insure continued development of Office for Mac — a Microsoft executive demonstrated a custom version of Office for iPad.</p>\n<p>The unresolved question is the one where Gates and Jobs diverged on their answers. Gates argued that tablets would become the norm, replacing the laptop. Jobs found success by creating a media delivery system that could, in a pinch, do some work. The serious stuff, you could do on a Mac.</p>\n<p>With the iPad Pro — armed with Surface-like keyboard, stylus, and Microsoft Office — Tim Cook seems to be tilting toward the Redmond doctrine.</p>\n<p>I’ll be fascinated to see how this strategy works out. Because when you tally up the cost of an iPad Pro with an Apple smart keyboard, and an Apple Pencil, you’re paying more than you would for 13-inch Macbook Air. Or, for that matter, a Chromebook Pixel. That keyboard better be good.</p>\n<p>Still, I can see the logic. Mobile operating systems now rule, as every major version of a desktop OS adopts more of the conventions of their mobile counterparts. So why not do all your cognitive heavy lifting on a mobile device? The hardware is good enough, the software is good enough, the batteries are good enough, and the wireless network is the air we breathe.</p>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>	2015-09-09 23:00:29.209008	2015-09-24 01:00:42.66258	<h2>How Bill Gates Predicted the iPad Pro</h2>\n<h4>Should a tablet do everything your laptop does?

9	3	How Far Away Is the Moon?	Aha! Moment	2015-05-28 13:45:09	621dd588c91e	<h4>Aha! Moment</h4>\n<p>Imagine staring up at the moon on a spring evening and wondering, “how far away is the moon?” What would you do to figure out how far away it is? Perhaps take out your smart phone to Google it? How is it then that the Greeks, who posed the same question 2,200 years ago, found the answer without the aid of Google, NASA, or any modern technology? The Greeks were able to determine a reasonably accurate distance from the earth to the moon using careful observations, measurements, and a clever geometric model of the situation. In the Eureka curriculum, when presented with this same question, <a href='http://www.centerdigitaled.com/k-12/Eureka-Math-Embeds-Real-World-Problems-in-PreK-12-Mathematics-Lessons.html' title='' rel=''>“students would use modeling or mathematical pictures — Eureka uses a short list of such flexible models throughout its 14 grades — to bridge the gap between the word problem and the abstract operations needed for the right answer.”</a></p>\n<h4>Identifying Key Information</h4>\n<p>The Greek astronomer and mathematician, Aristarchus of Samos, calculated the distance from the earth to the moon with only the following information:</p>\n<li>The earth’s diameter was approximately 8,000 miles (another ingenious calculation, made by Eratosthenes).</li>\n<li>Experimentation showed that in order to block out the sun with a spherical object, the ratio of the length of the object’s shadow to the object’s diameter must be 108:1. For example a one-inch marble can just block out the sun at 108 inches from the eye. If it were any further, the marble would appear smaller than the sun and a ring of light would be visible around the marble. If the marble were any closer than 108 inches, it would completely block out the sun. This phenomenon is true regardless of the size of the obstructing object and is also true in order to block out the moon, which has the same apparent size in the sky as the sun. It can be concluded, then, that the moon is 108 moon diameters away from the earth since it <em>just</em> blocks out the sun during a solar eclipse</li>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SA0FgTdR3AdlblGv61y5_A.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<li>Shadows cast by planetary bodies are conical in shape and are assumed to be similar. In a two dimensional view, then, the shadows cast by the moon and the earth are similar isosceles triangles:</li>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AwrN_R5OHBrv3epuIrsRxQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The next piece of information was a result of close observation of lunar eclipses.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OajpXHolh89tpT5A59Bznw.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<li>During a total eclipse, it was observed that the moon traveled a distance equal to two and one half moon diameters while passing through the earth’s shadow. Check out an animation of the moon passing through the earth’s shadow <a href='http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/eclipse3.htm' title='' rel=''>here</a></li>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*scmfSQp5F3y0iIIvBlokCw.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>Formulating a Model</h4>\n<p>With these pieces of information, a model was developed. In this model, the moon and its shadow is reversed so that one side of the shadow aligned with one side of the earth’s shadow and is positioned so that the moon’s shadow tapered just as it reached the earth. Let the moon diameter be equal to 1 unit. Then <em>AF </em>is 1 unit, and <em>FD </em>must be 2.5 units, as determined by the lunar eclipse observations</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uqBdyoAOuLs0JA33MZ8Qpw.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qw4E0toK5Py6E6E76z9Fpg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lYq3mzEpy-kZPFMWPpL6aQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>We have now established that the diameter of the moon, <em>AF</em>, has a length of approximately 2,300 miles. <em>AB </em>is 108 times this length. Then, based on the information we began with, the distance between the earth and the moon is (2,300 x 108) miles, or approximately 248,000 miles</p>\n<p>Modern-day calculations show that the distance from the earth to the moon varies between 225,622 miles and 252,088 miles due to the Earth’s orbit being elliptical versus circular. Still, Aristarchus managed to make an incredible estimation, considering the tools he had at his disposal and the magnitude of the distances he was working with.</p>\n<p>For any problem, whether it involves values of great magnitude as in this problem, or a more humble problem involving a number of cookies, a model allows us to make sense of what we are investigating by assigning a concrete visual or system to otherwise abstract mathematical manipulation. <a href='http://www.centerdigitaled.com/k-12/Eureka-Math-Embeds-Real-World-Problems-in-PreK-12-Mathematics-Lessons.html' title='' rel=''>“Familiarity with a few powerful models breeds comfort in learning mathematics.”</a></p>\n<p><em>This post is by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathgeometry?fref=ts' title='' rel='nofollow'>Pia Mohsen</a>, a former teacher, who is a Grade 10 writer for the </em><a href='http://www.eureka-math.org' title='' rel='nofollow'>Eureka Math</a> <em>curriculum.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:23.203515	2015-08-03 17:00:35.773504	<h4>Aha!

10	3	Rigid Motions from Grade 8 to 10	aha! moment	2015-05-05 17:59:26	c75304846760	<h4>Aha! Moment</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>My three-year-old niece was practicing her flashcards the other night (one of her favorite night-time activities!). She grouped all the rectangles together, arranging them so they were all horizontal. I rotated one card and asked her if the shape was still a rectangle, she replied with an emphatic, “NO! It’s THIS way,” and changed the orientation so it looked correct in her eyes. My niece has a long way to go before understanding the meaning of similarity and congruence, but as children explore geometry through “A Story of Units,” they develop a more sophisticated understanding of this concept of basic rigid motions.</p>\n<p>One of the major changes in geometry curriculum under the Common Core State Standards is the way congruence is defined using basic rigid motions. An example of coherence in the <em>Eureka Math</em> curriculum is the study of rigid motions in Grades 8 and 10. Students experience a transition from a pictorially based introduction to an abstract understanding</p>\n<p>The fundamentals of rigid motions are first introduced in Grade 8, Module 2. Students study translations, reflections, and rotations to build an intuitive understanding of each transformation. They are able to use a hands-on model of a rigid motion in order to describe the way each rigid motion behaves and list observable properties.</p>\n<p>What does this transition look like? For example, in Grade 8, a reflection is modeled by laying a sheet of transparency over a sheet of paper of the same size with the following figures drawn on it: a line, a ray, a segment, an angle, and two labeled points; one point is on the line, and one point is not on the line. The sheet of transparency is laid over the paper, and all the figures are traced by marker. To model the reflection, students flip the transparency over, and re-align the line on the transparency with the line on the paper. They observe that the reflection has not changed the fact that a line is still a line, and similarly, the ray, the segment, and the angle are still each of those figures, respectively, in the reflected version. They measure the length of the reflected segment and the angle measure and see that the measures are unchanged.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*mjRDJrxHMRo4Yi1FDm6A_A.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">These images are taken from Eureka Math Grade 8, Module 2 in the free Module PDFs on eureka-math.org.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Then in Grade 10, Module 1, precise language and notation is used to define each of the rigid motions. A reflection is formally defined:</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*z6lyXbnekDHW_eE05ga6Rg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">From www.eureka-math.org</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Constructions studied in this module inform students why reflections behave the way they do, and the properties formerly observed are proven using deductive reasoning. Once the basic rigid motions are established, students are able to reason whether or not figures in the plane are congruent. The transition then, is a progression from hands-on model and observation to purposeful drawing and, finally, to careful and precise use of language.</p>\n<p><em>Join the conversation about rotations, reflections, and translations on the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eureka-Math-Geometry/788314054589598' title='' rel=''>official Eureka Math Geometry Facebook page</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>The background image is from Grade 10, Module 1 in the Eureka Math Free PDF page, available at <a href='http://www.eureka-math.org.' title='' rel=''>www.eureka-math.org.</a></em></p>\n<p><em>This post is by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathgeometry?fref=ts' title='' rel=''>Pia Mohsen</a>, a former teacher, who is a Grade 10 writer for the </em><a href='http://www.eureka-math.org' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a> <em>curriculum.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:24.084157	2015-08-03 17:00:37.163591	<h4>Aha!

All you have to do is remember that,” I’d say.</p>\n<p>In doing a recent Google search for other mnemonics, I discovered that there are many more that teachers use ranging anywhere from ‘Dead Monkeys Smell Bad’ to ‘Dracula’s Mother Sucks Blood’ to ‘Does McDonalds Sell Cheese Burgers’ (the ‘C’ for compare).</p>\n<p>I would argue that the mnemonics listed above do not help students to build an understanding of division. Sure, they’re likely to remember the sayings, but will they be able to translate that knowledge to what’s actually happening with the process of division? I think not.</p>\n<p>Instead of relying on a ‘trick’, <em>Eureka Math</em> builds a deeper understanding of division, exploring the long division algorithm by coupling it with division using the place value chart and place value disks</p>\n<h4>What does it mean to divide?</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>When we divide, we make equal groups. This is not new concept for students. Children do it every day when they are dealing out cards, sharing cookies with friends, or figuring out how many players will be on each team in a game. Here, it’s the same thing — just with larger numbers.</p>\n<p>For example, we can express 435 ÷ 3 on the place value chart using place value disks. 435 = 4 hundreds 3 tens 5 ones.</p>\n<p>Notice that we do not use language, such as: “how many ___ are in ___” or “bring down the ___”. This language is not necessary when students conceptually understand the process. Understanding can be developed first through work at the concrete level with place value disks, then at the pictorial level by drawing place value disks on a place value chart, and finally through the abstract work of long division.</p>\n<h4>Division with Place Value Charts</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let’s begin. 435 ÷ 3:</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*U_9zGHd7f7A7WUWGded8bQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>We’ll make space on our chart to distribute the disks into 3 equal groups. First, let’s distribute the hundreds. There are 4 hundreds to distribute. We can distribute 3 hundreds.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*OtXd5nAZJ2hMP7HAzJ_lCA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>There is 1 hundred in each group and 1 hundred remaining. The remaining 1 hundred cannot be distributed evenly.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*Psum2XNqug1ch5FZEfzsDA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>We can decompose the remaining hundred for 10 tens. Now, there are 10 tens + 3 tens = 13 tens. We distribute 13 tens evenly among the 3 groups.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*xqTeZ9z9tsH_ZU-8Fb6-OQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>There are 4 tens in each group and 1 ten remaining. The remaining 1 ten cannot be distributed evenly.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*lAbTM3S3LVPvQX8PYEWDdw.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>We decompose the remaining ten for 10 ones. Now, there are 10 ones + 5 ones = 15 ones.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*uzKYiTI0TXkn2ob_pKb2Xg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>We distribute 15 ones evenly among the 3 groups so there are 5 ones in each group. There are zero ones remaining to distribute. Each group has 1 hundred 4 tens 5 ones.</p>\n<p>The place value disks enable us to see what was happening when we divided. We made equal groups by distributing the dividend, starting with the largest place value.</p>\n<h4>Division with the Standard Algorithm</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, let’s see how the work on the place value chart relates to the standard algorithm.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*TDDIWqaJJwfHZYIT0s_yxg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>435 ÷ 3 = 145</p>\n<p>Need some practice? Take the challenge of trying some other examples on your own. Mirror the language that is used above. Say the steps aloud. Think about the transfer from disks to the algorithm. Soon, you’ll find yourself visualizing the disks as you complete long division — the exact type of internal thinking that we strive to build within our students.</p>\n<p><em>To ask <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mary-Jones-Eureka-Math-Grade-4-Writer/1557111431208353?fref=ts' title='' rel=''>Mary Jones</a> questions about her blog post or connect with other</em> Eureka Math <em>teacher-writers and users, visit our <a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel=''>Facebook Page</a>.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:19.792679	2015-08-14 19:00:35.512553	<h4>Strategies</h4>\n<p><em>This post was written by Grade 4 </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a><em> writer <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mary-Jones-Eureka-Math-Grade-4-Writer/1557111431208353?fref=ts' title='' rel=''>Mary Jones</a>.</em></p>\n<p>In my first years of teaching fourth grade, when it was time for division of multi-digit numbers, I’d write “D, M, S, B” on the board in a vertical manner. “Dad, Mom, Sister, Brother.

Moment</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a teacher several years ago, I recall introducing my students to trigonometric ratios using the acronym “SOH CAH TOA.” If they remembered the acronym, students could calculate the trigonometric ratios sine, cosine, and tangent given a right triangle when they were provided with some information about the measures of angles and/or side lengths. This was the way I was introduced to trigonometry, and using the acronym reminded me how to calculate the values of trigonometric ratios for acute angles in right triangles. Teaching using just the acronym, though, deprives the students of an opportunity to understand what the ratios represent. Students may be able to tell you that sine can be calculated by finding the ratio of the length of the side opposite an angle in a right triangle to the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle.</p>\n\n<p>However, the acronym does not help them understand why the ratio is defined this way. Armed only with “SOH CAH TOA,” it becomes confusing for students to find the values of trigonometric ratios for angles whose measures are 90 degrees or greater, or negative. The acronym is not a bad tool, but it is insufficient to help students understand trigonometric ratios.</p>\n<h4>Using History to Explain What Sine Measures</h4>\n<p>The <em>Eureka Math</em> curriculum addresses the historical context that led to the formalizing of the trigonometric ratios sine, cosine, and tangent. It describes the research of ancient astronomers who were interested in the position of stars, and in particular, the heights of the stars in the sky. The lesson outlines the research of ancient Indian astronomer-mathematician Aryabhata I, whose ideas built upon those of ancient Babylonian and Greek astronomers. He believed that the stars rotated about the Earth in circular orbits. The diagram below models the sun rotating counterclockwise about the Earth in a circular orbit relative to an observer standing on the Earth’s surface and facing north. The sun rises in the east (to the right) and then rotates counterclockwise until it sets in the west (to the left). The shaded region represents when the sun would not be visible to the observer</p>\n\n<p>To model the movement of the sun, we could measure the angle of elevation of the sun as it moves counterclockwise, as shown:</p>\n\n<p>The position of the sun relative to the earth could be determined using only the distance <em>r</em> and the angle of elevation of the sun with the horizon (the horizontal line through point <em>E</em>). Since the radius is constant in our model, the perceived height of the sun is determined solely by the angle of elevation <em>x</em> measured in degrees</p>\n<p>The research of Aryabhata I provided a means by which the height of astronomical objects could be calculated.</p>\n\n<p>Aryabhata I used the abbreviation <em>jya</em> (pronounced <em>jhah</em>) for half of the length of the chord joining the endpoints of the arc of a circle. The term <em>jya</em> was an abbreviation for a Sanskrit term representing a half-chord of a circle, and the value <em>jya</em> represents the height of a star for a given angle of counterclockwise rotation from the eastern horizon</p>\n<p>In his text <em>Aryabhatiya</em>, Aryabhata constructed a table of values of the <em>jya</em> in increments of 3 3/4 degrees, which were used to calculate the positions of astronomical objects</p>\n<h4>From J<em>ya </em>to Sin</h4>\n<>Transcribed letter-by-letter into Arabic in the 10th century, <em>jya</em> became <em>jiba</em>. In medieval writing, scribes regularly omitted vowels to save time, space, and resources, so the Arabic scribes wrote just <em>jb</em>. Since <em>jiba</em> isn’t a real word in Arabic, later readers interpreted <em>jb</em> as <em>jaib</em>, which is an Arabic word meaning cove or bay. When translated into Latin around 1150 C.E., <em>jaib</em> became <em>sinus</em>, which is the Latin word for <em>bay</em>. <em>Sinus</em> got shortened into <em>sine</em> in English. (<a href='http://greatminds.net/maps/images/math_documents/G11-M2_Teacher_Edition.pdf' title='' rel=''><em>Eureka Math A Story of Functions</em>, Grade 11, Module 2, Lesson 3</a></>\n<h4>Why This Matters</h4>\n<p>While it is interesting to learn about how the term <em>jya</em> evolved into the term <em>sine</em>, the importance of the history behind <em>sine</em> is that students understand it represents a height. Within the context of astronomy, it represents the height of an object in the sky. In a mathematical context, it represents the vertical distance from the center of the unit circle to any point on that circle. Knowing this is extremely important when the students are required to expand their understanding of trigonometry beyond right triangles. When viewing sine as a height, it is much easier to understand when sine is positive (when a point is above the center of the circle) and when it is negative (when the point is below the center). It is easier to consider whether or not calculated values are reasonable. For instance, the sine of an angle that has a very small positive value will be close to zero, because an object in the sky would be just above the horizon line. Understanding the history helps students understand the graphs of trigonometric functions as well. For instance, it makes sense that the graph of <em>y</em> = sin(<em>x</em>) has a relative maximum at <em>x</em> = 90 degrees because this would represent when the sun is directly overhead at its maximum perceived height in the sky</p>\n<p>This illustration demonstrates that providing a historical context for mathematics can not only engage students, but help them to understand mathematical concepts in a way that is richer than providing the information without a context.</p>\n<p><em>This post is authored by Sara Lack, a </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial?ref=tn_tnmn' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a> <em>writer for </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eureka-Math-Grades-9-12/788314054589598?ref=tn_tnmn' title='' rel=''>A Story of Functions</a><em>.</em></p>	2015-07-31 21:00:14.798621	2015-09-24 01:00:25.461961	<h4>Aha!

While I’m generally a proponent of kids reading a good book and splashing in the pool, there are certainly ways in which parents can support their child’s maintenance of grade-appropriate fluency skills and goals. Summer math practice isn’t about flashcards. And it certainly doesn’t have to be a drag. The Eureka curriculum offers a number of summer fluency activities within the K-2 grade band, many of which can be accessed via the <a href='http://greatminds.net/maps/math/module-pdfs' title='' rel=''>free pdfs</a> featured on the <a href='http://greatminds.net/maps/math/home' title='' rel=''><em>Eureka Math</a></em> website or by way of <a href='https://www.pinterest.com/eurekamath0130/' title='' rel=''>Pinterest.</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Preparing for Grade 1</strong></h3>\n<p>In the final lesson of Kindergarten Module 6 Lesson 7 (M6 L7), students create a booklet entitled, “I’m Getting Ready for First Grade! My Math Fluency Kit.” As a part of this kit, teachers assemble copies of Sprints and Fluency Activity Sheets for summer practice.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Wte4UGjX88WtEXBRCm5bXA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Sheets can be inserted into personal white boards (shown at right) so that they can be used multiple times over the summer. (Most children prefer using the dry erase markers as a fun alternative to the No. 2 pencil.) The selection of appropriate Sprints and Fluency Activities will vary from class to class and student to student. Students are encouraged to keep a “My Sprint Progress Log” (shown below) to record their progress.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*rGAXR6xDqqnghtHNbOQUFw.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the goal is to celebrate growth and improvement. Encourage parents to have fun; we want all children to feel good about math!</p>\n<p>Kits can be sent home in folders and re-sealable plastic bags to house any number of consumable materials, for example:</p>\n<li>two hands mat (M1 L19)</li>\n<li>5-frames (M1 L7)</li>\n<li>number path (M1 L15)</li>\n<li>ten dot path (M3 L5)</li>\n<li>matching game cards (M4 L1 & L7)</li>\n<li>number bond template (M4 L2)</li>\n<li>5-group cards (M1 L7)</li>\n<li>personal Rekenreks (made in M5)</li>\n<p>Additionally, students can count out 10 red and white beans to take home in a bag. Note that the materials suggested above are accompanied by Fluency activities, samples of which can be copied for summer practice.</p>\n<p>Teachers may wish to send home the Core Fluency Practice Sets (A-E) initially found in Module 4 Lesson 29: <em>My Addition Practice, My Decomposition Practice, My Subtraction Practice (Sets C & D), and My Mixed Practice to 5</em>. In addition, there is also a set of Core Fluency Sprints (A-D) located in Module 4 Lesson 31. The table below highlights additional Sprints for parents requesting further remedial support</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SModJ-Euip5JZHk-mObk1Q.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I’m sticking firmly to my belief that summer <em>and</em> math should be fun. Below is a Fluency activity from Module 4 Lesson 32 that anticipates the work of Grade 1. Students can assemble the dot cards to make 10 and write the corresponding number bond. Students love these puzzles</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KbnrJh8NcVleY0eLRo-SCQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h3><strong>Preparing for Grade 2</strong></h3>\n<p>In Grade 1 Module 6 Lesson 28, students celebrate progress in fluency with adding and subtracting within 10 (and 20). Based on the needs of their class, teachers create a number of fluency celebration centers, such as <em>Target Practice</em>, <em>Race to the Top</em>, and <em>Make Ten Addition and <a href='https://www.pinterest.com/pin/455708056021078123/' title='' rel=''>Take from Ten Subtraction with Partners</a> </em>(pictured below), to name a few. Parents can play these games with their children over the summer to continue to reinforce the Grade 1 fluency goal of sums and differences through 10. Keep in mind that when sending home summer activities, it is important to clarify tricky vocabulary or terminology, such as <em>minuend</em>, for parents</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*9nzPaPWzqUJ74GqEVbGneQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Grade 1 students are encouraged to teach family members a number of counting activities, as shown below in their first summer homework task (M6 <a href='https://medium.com/p/7a267141dc79/edit' title='' rel=''>L28</a>)</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VHlqcHYaDRzhSniEuOVPSQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>As in Kindergarten, Grade 1 teachers may create packets of the Core Fluency Practice Sets (A-E) initially found in Module 4 Lesson 23: <em>Addition Practice, Missing Addend Practice, Related Addition and Subtraction Practice, Subtraction Practice, and Mixed Practice</em>. These practice pages encourage students to think flexibly, as the unknown is placed in various positions when adding, e.g., 7 = ___ + 4, ___ = 5 + 4, and problems are carefully sequenced to encourage the recognition of patterns and relationships between numbers<strong> </strong>up to 10</p>\n<p>Both Kindergarten and Grade 1 students may enjoy a few computer games as well: NCTM has <a href='http://illuminations.nctm.org/Activity.aspx?id=3565' title='' rel=''>ten frame games</a> that support counting, cardinality, and partners to 10. This game, along with <a href='http://pbskids.org/curiousgeorge/busyday/ten/' title='' rel=''>Curious George’s Museum of Tens</a> from PBS Kids, is sure to be a crowd pleaser</p>\n<h3><strong>Preparing for Grade 3</strong></h3>\n<p>As in the previous grades, Grade 2 teachers may also wish to create summer packets of the Core Fluency Practice Sets (A-E), provided in Grade 2 Module 5 Lesson 14. These sets review sums and differences through 20.</p>\n<p>In addition, Eureka curriculum writer Colleen Sheeron has shared a week-by-week <a href='https://www.pinterest.com/pin/455708056022195668/' title='' rel=''>summer calendar</a> full of activities for students entering Grade 3 in the fall. One game highlighted is Race and Roll Addition (see Directions below)</p>\n<>Start at 0. Partners take turns rolling a die, saying a number sentence, and adding the number rolled to the total. For example, Partner A rolls 6 and says, “0 + 6 = 6,” then Partner B rolls 3 and says, “6 + 3 = 9.” They continue rapidly rolling and saying number sentences until they get to 20, without going over. For example, if the partners are at 18 and roll 5, they take turns rolling until one of them rolls a 2 or rolls 1 twice. The winner is the partner who makes the final roll to make 20.</>\n<p>A favorite game of my students is one that can be purchased through <a href='https://www.didax.com/' title='' rel=''>Didax</a>, <a href='http://www.didax.com/shop/productdetails.cfm/Keyword/tri%20facta/Sort/Item/Order/Asc/StartRow/1/ShowAll/No/ItemNo/263038.cfm' title='' rel=''>tri-FACTa</a></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lDe4mVR1hTU71Wfa29_INg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Students recall their number bond work to create addition and subtraction number sentences. To alter the difficulty level, simply add or remove numbers after ten from the game. Additionally, if you are a fan of the infamous game “Pass the Pigs,” then you may wish to introduce <a href='https://www.youcubed.org/task/pig/' title='' rel=''>Pig</a> to your students. It’s sure to generate some laughter as it tempts them to roll for a higher score. Finally, for children who thrive off of screen time, additional resources for smartphones and tablets from <a href='http://motionmathgames.com/parents/' title='' rel=''>Motion Math</a> are worth the small investment</p>\n<p>Math is everywhere; we don’t have to look hard to find it. Encourage families to play a few games and/or make a summer activity calendar together. Fluency practice doesn’t need to take more than 5–10 minutes per day. A child’s natural curiosity and enjoyment will follow if it’s not a drag. Kids will take that cue from the adults in their lives. So encourage parents to have fun with it too!</p>\n<p><em>This blog was authored by MaryJo Wieland, a writer for </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial?ref=hl' title='' rel='nofollow'>Eureka Math</a> A Story of Units<em>.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:15.51806	2015-09-02 09:00:30.871248	<h4>FAQ Response</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>“What should Johnny do over the summer?” This is the most frequently asked question at spring conferences.

29	4	Making Sense of Math, Not Just Finding the Answer: A Field Report from Berkeley, CA	Lori MacDonald — K-5 Math Coach, Berkeley (CA) Unified School District	2015-06-05 20:17:00	27a5cfaf2bb2	<h4><strong>Lori MacDonald — </strong><em>K-5 Math Coach, Berkeley (CA) Unified School District</em></h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*5N_rSIykCrYKECA7aR7kYw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">“It’s taking some time to get students, teachers, and parents to understand that our goal is about making sense of math, not in just finding the right answer.”</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><em>Lori MacDonald is a K–5 math coach in the Berkeley (CA) Unified School District. She answers some of our questions and talks about how</em> Eureka Math<em> is affecting teaching and learning in the Northern California district, which serves nearly 10,000 students.</em></p>\n<p><strong>How is <em>Eureka Math</em> implementation going in Berkeley schools?</strong></p>\n<p>Student learning has been impacted in two areas: One, students have a better conceptual understanding of what’s going on when they’re performing operations or considering numbers. This sounds like a simple assertion, but it’s large and profound — students understand the math they are doing across the board much more than they have in the past. Two, students are more able to solve complex problems, explain their reasoning, and learn from their own and others’ errors. The tape diagram is one of the most useful models we’ve used; it’s helping us all, teachers and students alike, to reason abstractly and quantitatively before we start applying algorithms. Students are more likely to wonder, “What’s going on here and how can I represent it?” than to just start adding or dividing.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve been working to help Berkeley parents understand the shifts in math instruction under new college- and career-ready standards and the aligned <em>Eureka Math </em>curriculum. Why do you see that as critical, and how has that been going?</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the models and methods for developing deep conceptual understanding in students seem laborious — you can get the right answer by doing a more simple procedure. So it’s taking some time to get students, teachers, and parents to understand that our goal is about making sense of math, not in just finding the right answer. This means we need to give students time to learn the models, however clunky they might seem in any given week. And we need to encourage our students and children to explain their thinking, explain what they know about the models they’re using.</p>\n<p><strong>How have teachers in your district shifted their instructional practices under <em>Eureka Math</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>The instruction is definitely more focused and coherent. The teachers are less confused about the math they’re learning. It’s also been a big stretch with the rigor in many grades (depending on the module), so we are all building our capacity to persevere in problem solving.</p>	2015-07-09 05:00:45.028803	2015-08-24 07:00:42.248695	<h4><strong>Lori MacDonald — </strong><em>K-5 Math Coach, Berkeley (CA) Unified School District</em></h4>

How Preparation and Collaboration Can Help All Students Achieve	From the Field	2015-08-27 19:46:02	d207e6bd7d43	<h4>From the Field</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Before anything else, preparation is the key to success” — Alexander Graham Bell</em></p>\n<p>I spent most of my early teaching career admiring many very talented teachers in my school and trying to emulate some of their strategies. I thought being a great teacher was something I had to work hard to become, but, in retrospect, I invested my effort in the wrong way. I observed the classrooms of these ‘gifted’ teachers, focusing on how each classroom was organized — the posters on the walls and the arrangements of the seats. Conversations with the teachers about how they planned their lessons, studied the teaching materials, made connections, and encouraged critical thinking would have been a much better use of my time since this would have allowed me to focus on crucial components that would drive my students towards increased achievement.</p>\n<p>There is a resource that is incredibly beneficial for the success of your students and one that is probably underutilized- your colleagues! In a recent professional development session in Hartford, CT, a fellow author for <em>Eureka Math</em>, Danielle Goedel, and I were inspired by the ideas generated from our participants. Their collaboration and willingness to share and reflect had a tremendous impact on the entire group. Many of these teachers commented that their students needed lesson modifications. In fact one of the most common questions posed is “How can I modify the curriculum for my students?” As a response to this question, we suggest YOU are the single greatest resource for the students in your class</p>\n<p>By studying the math in the lessons, analyzing the complexities, collaborating with your colleagues, and preparing your delivery of the lessons, you will reap amazing rewards as you try to move your students toward achieving desired student outcomes.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at Example 3 and Exercise 3 from Grade 7 Module 3.</p>\n\n<p>As participants in the group studied the teaching materials and noted the increasing complexities between the two problems shown above, they noted the following:</p>\n<li>The problems contain the same angle relationship but there are 4 angles in Exercise 3 instead of 3 angles.</li>\n<li>Instead of x<strong>°</strong>, there is now (x+1)<strong>° </strong>in Exercise 3</li>\n<p>As the discussions within each team continued, one participant noticed that students are not actually asked to find the value of x, so (x+1)<strong>°</strong> can actually be considered a distractor. She suggested preparing a scaffold for the students in a particular class, replacing the (x+1)<strong>° </strong>with another variable such as y<strong>°. </strong>Another participant realized that this modification really simplifies the problem as it makes Example 3 and Exercise 3 very similar. If students are successful in completing Example 3 with their teacher, their ability to successfully complete Exercise 3 independently is much higher. Using a sticky note to cover up the distractor and substitute y<strong>°</strong> would be a useful modification for this problem. The teacher is able to place and remove the sticky as students become comfortable with the concept, temporarily eliminating the distractor and fostering growth in learning</p>\n<p>Another participant strove to demystify that tricky (x+1)<strong>° </strong>by changing the measurements of the other angles to (58+1)<strong>°,</strong> (102+1)<strong>°,</strong> and<strong> </strong>(166+1)°. Seeing this modification may help alleviate any worry students experience with the added complexity of the term (x+1)<strong>°.</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the goals of the professional development session, “Preparation and Customization of a <em>Eureka Math</em> Lesson,” is to make intelligent decisions to guide your students from the beginning of the lesson, <em>up the ladder </em>to the end of the lesson, focusing on the desired student outcomes an end goal. The ladder analogy is used to describe the sequence of learning, where the first rung of the ladder is the beginning of the lesson and the highest rung of the ladder is the end of the lesson, which is the desired student outcome(s). The ladder analogy is useful in thinking of the lowest rung as the students’ <em>point of last success</em> and the highest rung as the problem that students need to complete successfully</p>\n<p>Often, rungs of the ladder are spaced too far apart, and scaffolding problems are needed to assist students who are unable to reach the next rung. Other times, the rungs of the ladder are too close together and students are well able to reach the next rung and maybe able to skip a rung. The beauty of this preparation process is that the prepared teacher is able to anticipate stumbling blocks because they have:</p>\n<li>done the math prior to teaching the lesson</li>\n<li>analyzed the complexities of the problems</li>\n<li>prepared scaffolding problems in case they are needed during the lesson</li>\n<p>Collaborating with colleagues is a great way to identify and address potential stumbling blocks and to help each student move successfully and confidently toward success on the Exit Ticket, thereby meeting the lesson’s objective.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine not having done the work listed above prior to teaching the Grade 7 lesson. Would you have been able to modify the problem and create spur-of-the-moment scaffolds to prevent your students from falling into the pit of unproductive struggle? Finding time to do this analysis and collaborate with colleagues may be hard, but it is certainly worth the effort since it benefits those who matter most- our students!</p>\n<p>Identifying the last point of success, then collaborating with colleagues about how to modify lessons to accommodate the needs of the students (with scaffolds or extensions) can lead to increased success, more positive attitudes, and reveal additional connections to prior learning. Time is precious. As you prepare for a successful year, use your planning and collaboration time with colleagues wisely to maximize your impact on student learning.</p>\n<p><em>This post is by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dawn-Pensack-Eureka-Math-Grades-5-6/1628157847414042' title='' rel='nofollow'>Dawn Pensack</a> who is a Grades 5–6 </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel='nofollow'>Eureka Math</a><em> writer.

5	3	Pacing and Preparation	Spotlight a Resource	2015-07-29 12:35:01	86028d11b2a2	<h4>Spotlight a Resource</h4>\n<p>A frequent concern voiced by teachers is the pacing of instruction. In an ideal world, teachers would have enough time to closely study all the modules of their grade level well in advance of the school year and collaborate with colleagues on a detailed plan of implementation. To support the realistic schedules of educators, the Pacing and Preparation Guides are intended to provide an efficient and systematic plan of attack for implementation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Preparing to Teach a Module</strong></h3>\n<p>At the opening of this guide, each module of <em>A Story of Units (or Ratios, or Functions)</em> is likened to a chapter of a book. Just as we follow the plot of a story, how it builds and how each scene impacts what happens next, so we see a parallel development in each module. The process in this guide will help you establish the ‘plot’ of the module; it will stage how the math progresses in the module. There are three major steps</p>\n<h4><strong>Step 1 — Preview the Plot</strong></h4>\n<li>Read the Table of Contents. This is an initial snapshot of the module; it provides a quick view of what is happening in the module from beginning to end.</li>\n<li>Preview the module’s Exit Tickets. This provides a tangible sense of what students are intended to achieve by the close of each lesson.</li>\n<h4><strong>Step 2 — Dig into the details.</strong></h4>\n<li>In this step, start by looking a broad overview and slowly narrow your study to specific objectives.</li>\n<li>Read the Module Overview. The Module Overview begins to fill in the outline formed from reading the Table of Contents. The idea is to refer to the lessons and Topic Overviews within a Module as you read and make sense of how the content and instructional strategies are framed.</li>\n<li>Read the Student Objectives, which are more refined goals for each lesson</li>\n<h4><strong>Step 3 — Summarize the story.</strong></h4>\n<li>To be completely familiar with where students are headed in the module, the Mid- and End-of-Module Assessments should now be completed. As each problem is solved, refer, again, to the lessons in order to analyze the intent of the problems and consider how students will solve them.</li>\n<p>Without having read every line of every lesson, you will have an understanding of the major work, including major content, strategies, learning objectives, and ultimately, the big picture of the module.</p>\n<h3><strong>Preparing to Teach a Lesson</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>When getting ready to teach the lessons, follow the steps outlined in this guide, which go beyond a straight-through reading of the lesson.</p>\n<h4><strong>Step 1 — Discern the Plot</strong></h4>\n<p>In order to get a feel for where the lesson falls in the scope of the Module, quickly review the Table of Contents of the module, followed by the appropriate Topic Overview, the Student Outcome, and Exit Ticket of each lesson of the topic. Finally, review the Mid- or End-of-Module assessment that follows the lesson.</p>\n<h4><strong>Step 2 — Find the Ladder</strong></h4>\n<p>The ladder represents the sequence of skills or learning the student must have to successfully complete the lesson. With an understanding of where the lesson fits in within the module, now complete all questions in the lesson, including the Closing questions. Observe how the successive problems are changing and what each new level of complexity to the question implies in terms of student thinking. Note these changes; each new level of complexity is a rung on the ladder.</p>\n<h4><strong>Step 3 — Hone the Lesson</strong></h4>\n<p>With a thorough understanding of the lesson, it can now be tailored to suit your class. Anticipate where students will struggle and categorize portions of the lesson and questions as ‘Must Do’ (most students can do), ‘Could Do’ (students with greater understanding and fluency can do), and ‘Challenge!’ (students ready for more advanced work). These planned distinctions will allow you to pivot your class, or help target work for specific students. Though questions are being cherry-picked for each category, the goal is to pick them in such a way that keeps the story of the lesson in tact. For example, a selection should keep a similar mix of conceptual, abstract, and application types of problems as found in the whole lesson. The following chart is included in the guide to help determine the customization needed for remedial work:</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*vK0l5i5zKwbUkFtbo4jaaA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">This chart is taken from the Eureka Math Pacing and Preparation Guides.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h3><strong>Suggestions for Consolidation or Omissions</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>For grade levels where substantially more of the 180-day school year is needed for instruction, a final section of the Pacing and Preparation Guide has been dedicated to suggestions on how to adjust the curriculum in the situation that teachers need to reduce the number of instructional days. Suggestions of where to modify each module of the grade level are made based on the Student Objectives, the work of each lesson, and so that the overall intention of the module is unaltered.</p>\n<p>All of the <a href='http://greatminds.net/maps/math/pacing-guides' title='' rel=''>Pacing and Preparation Guides</a> can be found on the Great Minds website.

11	3	Precise Fraction Language	aha! moment	2015-05-05 21:10:01	2c33e51e3d38	<h4>Strategy</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Old habits die hard. I get it. During a recent power outage, I had to laugh at how often I’d enter a room and flip the switch knowing full well that nothing would happen. I can understand how teachers often forget about how important it is to use precise language during math instruction. We’ve gotten so used to saying certain things that it’s hard, in the midst of all that teachers do, to recall, for example, that a fraction can be “expressed in its simplest form” rather than “reduced”. Maybe if we had a clearer understanding of why certain phrases or terms are preferable to others it would encourage us to more regularly use precise and accurate language.</p>\n<p><em>Reducing Fractions</em></p>\n<p>I’m not sure where the term “reduced fraction” comes from and it really doesn’t matter. What I do know is that outside the context of math, the word “reduce” means to make smaller. If your boss told you your salary was going to be reduced, I’m sure you wouldn’t interpret the statement to mean that your paychecks would now be expressed in simplest form! I also know that it’s common for a student to be confused by an equation showing:</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*l0gVsUzY1K9htnMsSokoTw.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Visually students can see that the value of the digits in both the numerator and the denominator have become smaller, so it’s difficult initially to understand that these fractions are, in fact, equivalent. Combine that with the fact that a student’s teacher may be saying, “the fraction 3 sixths can be <em>reduced</em> to 1 half,” and you can see why a student would have further reason to be confused by the equation shown. Therefore, phrases like, “rename it in its simplest form” or “rename it using the largest units possible” are more likely to help students deepen their understanding of fractions</p>\n<p><em>Improper Fractions</em></p>\n<p>Another term that is used too frequently is “improper fraction.” Of course, improper fraction <em>is</em> a mathematically correct term used to describe a fraction like <strong>5/3</strong>, where the numerator is larger than the denominator. Likewise, a fraction where the numerator is smaller than the denominator, like <strong>2/7</strong>, is called a “proper fraction.” Yet how often do we say that? The point is, just because it’s correct to say something doesn’t mean it’s helpful for a student to hear it repeatedly. Again, what does the word “improper” mean outside of a math context? Wrong! Incorrect! Not right! I can vividly recall the many times when students would calculate a sum or product, which resulted in a fraction greater than one (e.g., <strong>7/4</strong>) and they’d think, “that’s an improper fraction, I must’ve done something wrong.” Instead, call them “fractions greater than 1.” In doing so you’ll let students know that there is nothing incorrect about these numbers, and also remind them that these fractions have a value that is greater than 1</p>\n<p><em>Common Denominator</em></p>\n<p>In order to add and subtract fractions we need to have common denominators. However, when multiplying fractions common denominators are not necessary. When dividing fractions common denominators are helpful but not necessary. While all of this may be true, is it necessary to express to students? By articulating all of these <em>rules</em> for fractions, we’re inherently telling students that fractions are different: they can’t be counted or operated like whole numbers and are more difficult to work with when solving problems. The truth is, fractions <em>are</em> numbers and they can be counted, manipulated, renamed, and operated just like whole numbers</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*ME5Luw-dMksw0buC6mwWig.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Notice that in both of the sequences above, in order to complete the final number sentence, one must rename and find a <em>common unit</em>. For example, cats and dogs can be renamed as pets or animals, and then added. Likewise, thirds and halves can be renamed as sixths or twelfths and then added. The phrase, “common unit” therefore applies to both whole number and fraction operations. It also helps students see and hear that fractions are numbers too and they don’t require their own set of rules</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Adam-Baker-Eureka-Math-Grade-5/456389434516178' title='' rel=''><em>Adam Baker</a> is a former 5th grade teacher from Marlboro, New York.

In Swartzenegger speak he retorts, “It’s not a toomah!” Sometimes I wish I had the thick Austrian accent to blurt out, “It’s not a script!”</em></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*ic-LbP8ld99R6C8uJpbAXA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">From Google images.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The writers of the <em>Eureka Math</em> curriculum deliberately designed lessons in the style of vignettes that illustrate what it might sound like in a classroom that is rolling out a rigorous curriculum. The downside? There is a general misunderstanding among some teachers that lessons are to be read as a script</p>\n<p>This was not our intent. Rather, it was to provide teachers with exemplars of instructional situations. We wanted to provide our users with a lesson design that captured the following:</p>\n<li>A carefully crafted sequence of problems increasing in complexity.</li>\n<li>In many cases, movement from the concrete to pictorial to abstract.</li>\n<li>The terminology, language, models, and tools to say and do what is intended by the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).</li>\n<li>Evidence of content being presented as part of a coherent story (PK-12) wherein skills build upon skills and conceptual understandings are developed as themes unfold.</li>\n<p>If you’ve felt constrained by Eureka lessons, then this is good news! All of us at Great Minds believe that lessons should be delivered and customized to suit the needs of your students and the culture of your school. The vignettes of student-teacher interactions are meant to spark discussion among colleagues and foster a collaborative community.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, let’s examine a Grade 2 lesson with renaming (G2-M4-L11). After studying this lesson, teachers might highlight specific places for emphasis as they guide the students through solving 35 minus 9.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*KOtpJwQg1TNSrHnPM3cjnw.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">I can break apart, or un-bundle, a unit of ten into 10 ones. We also call this decomposing. So if I decompose one of these tens to make 10 ones, how many ones will I have?”</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This notion of composing and decomposing can be intimidating for teachers who “borrowed” and “carried the one.” The instructional decisions being modeled in the vignettes are meant to provide coherent learning sequences to support teachers as they sharpen their teaching craft and guide students along a continuum of knowledge. I have found, through reading and studying these vignettes, what a classroom that is fostering a much deeper level of understanding looks and sounds like. Because our curriculum spans PK-12, the instructional decisions presented in the vignettes stem from what came before in the previous grades and anticipate the work of subsequent grades. Our hope is that the sample dialogue is able to unify content and make it more coherent throughout the grade levels without being stifling for teachers.</p>\n<p>Those teachers who are not bogged down by the notion of a “script,” are telling me that they feel supported. They feel that they have the tools to support students on the road to a more comprehensive conceptual understanding. They also tell me that they “don’t get it all right.” I don’t either!. Sometimes it’s messy. But as a writer, I can sleep at night knowing that teachers have the support they need to feel empowered and to communicate to students in a way that honors the integrity of the standards.</p>\n<p><em>This blog post was authored by MaryJo Wieland, a </em><a href='http://www.facebook.com/EurekaMathOfficial' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a> <em>writer for Pre-K and Grade 2.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:17.007134	2015-08-27 19:00:31.58159	<h4>FAQ Response</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>If you’ve seen the 1990 box office comedy Kindergarten Cop, then you likely recall Arnold Swartzenegger snapping at a precocious 5-year-old boy who suggests that his headache might be a tumor.

We have 34 elementary schools, and we have a large transient population. Getting to one curriculum, getting on the same page was big.</p>\n<p>When we decided on Eureka, our biggest pushback was in the early grades. Second-grade teachers were vocal. I think it’s because our elementary teachers teach everything. They aren’t necessarily math teachers. In 2nd grade, the curriculum is one of the hardest. They’re introducing a lot more strategies. We’ve been trying to give extra support to that grade.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you support teachers?</strong></p>\n<p>Every time we roll out a new module, before implementing that module, we pull the teachers in and have a professional development day. Rather than having me do that, we’re having some teacher leaders present that information. Teachers dive in and break down the information. That seems to be really beneficial.</p>\n<p>At first, I think the teachers were kind of like, “Why are we doing this?” Now that they see what is coming with the PARCC exam, they’re like, “Oh I see why we’re doing that.” Seeing what’s coming with the PARCC test, they’re saying “Eureka is going to help me with that.”</p>\n<p>They’re finding their groove with it. Many are saying, “This has made the difference in my classroom.”</p>\n<p><strong>How are the students progressing?</strong></p>\n<p>The middle school curriculum specialist is excited about what we’re doing in the elementary grades because we’re getting the kids ready. We’re not using cutesy little words anymore. We’re using the word “algorithm” in first grade.</p>\n<p>They are understanding the meaning behind the math. It’s promoting deeper thinking. In explaining this to a parent, or someone who doesn’t know Eureka, I would show that if we’re working on addition and regrouping, I would have the parent work the problem and the kid work it with the number disc. He or she would show that when you exchange it like this, you do this, or would explain that with 21, you have two 10s and one 1. They truly have an understanding of number sense. They understand what that number means.</p>\n<p>Our schools have held math nights, and they’ve been very successful. In some instances, these parents sit down in a chair, and the children are teaching their parents how to do the math.</p>\n<p><strong>How is <em>Eureka Math</em> different from other approaches you’ve used?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s that deeper understanding, and with <em>Eureka Math</em>, the strategies are different.

Response to a FAQ	2015-07-07 18:30:23	d253cd963bea	<h4>FAQ Response</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Recently during a national mathematics conference, I posed the question, “How many of us understand the difference between partitive and measurement division?” Out of the 165 participants in the room, only two participants raised their hand. This lead me to think that somehow this information isn’t as widely understood as I initially thought, or hoped. Let’s begin with understanding missing factors and how they relate to division interpretation.</p>\n<p><strong>Missing Factors:</strong></p>\n<p>A student’s ability to set a path to solve division problems with real-world contexts lies heavily in understanding what has often been referred to as the “missing factor” approach. Starting with this approach, students can intuitively decide which interpretation of division is most efficient when applying to real-world contexts. Let’s take a look at 24÷6 as a solution to the following:</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sxaCDCNLI3yJ4lfLXyPNbA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The first interpretation asks, “24 is 6 groups, or parts, of what number, or size?” Since we know the original amount, and the number of parts, it is the size of the parts that is missing. Hence, we use <em>partitive </em>division to determine the size of the parts that is missing. The<strong> diagram</strong> below shows this rationale</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4-nVXlk7nULzfbNvlrAvuA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Note that the diagram is divided equally into the 6 known parts.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The second interpretation asks, “24 is how many groups, or parts, of 6?” Here we know the original amount and the size (or measure) of each of the parts. What is missing is the number of parts. We use <em>measurement </em>division to determine the missing number of parts. The <strong>diagram</strong> below shows this rationale</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*W0CFq5BsTT9Voq68dwupUA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Note that we can label the known measure of each part, but we must figure out how many parts of this known measure there are in 24.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Measurement Interpretation and How it Relates to Division of Fractions:</strong></p>\n<>Savannah has 1/2 yard of fabric to make placemats for her dining room table. She needs 1/8 yard of fabric for each placemat. How many placemats will Savannah make with 1/2 yard of fabric?</>\n<p>The underlying division expression associated with this context is 1/2 ÷ 1/8. We can look at this from the measurement interpretation of division. We can ask ourselves, “1/2 is how many groups, or parts, of 1/8?” or more simply, “How many 1/8 are there in 1/2? We can model this with a <strong>diagram:</strong></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TkvZq1YCKnAJZecIfeRqUw.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>It is clear from the <strong>diagram</strong> that there are 4 parts, or equal groups, of 1/8 in 1/2. Hence, Savannah will be able to make 4 placemats. Sometimes the context of the problem with the same division expression calls for a different approach</p>\n<p><strong>Partitive Interpretation and How it Relates to Division of Fractions</strong></p>\n<>Savannah is making curtains for her dining room and has 1/2 yard of fabric. According to the craft store clerk, this is only 1/8 the amount of fabric she needs. How many yards of fabric will Savannah need to make the curtains?</>\n<p>The underlying division expression associated with this context is, again, 1/2 ÷ 1/8. We can look at this from the partitive interpretation of division. Since we know the original amount, we can ask ourselves, “1/2 is 1/8 group of what size?” or more simply, “1/2 is 1/8 of what size?” We can model this with a <strong>diagram</strong></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sqBX_MlglNtQ-oK2xObKDA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Note that there are eight equal parts and one of those groups is labeled 1/2.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>We can rely on unit form to determine the size. We know that 1 unit out of 8 is equal to 1/2. We also know that we need to know how many 8 units are.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tlrTU9eAJT0Qz8FOT0PDDA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>What is opportune about <em>partitive </em>division<em> </em>is the direct connection to the invert and multiply rule. Can you see during the partitive process where the invert and multiply rule appears? Let’s take a closer look</p>\n<p><strong>Partitive Interpretation and How it Relates to Division of Fractions and the Invert and Multiply Rule:</strong></p>\n<p>We, as educators, in the past have always told our students to “Keep, Change, Flip” when dividing fractions. Students keep the dividend the same, change the operation of division to multiplication and then flip the divisor. Since the process was never explained, this “trick” is mostly meaningless to students. Students who are fluent with partitive division can intuitively notice the direct connection between partitive interpretation of division and the invert and multiply rule. Out of context, let’s look at and evaluate the expression 3/4 ÷ 2/3. We can begin by asking ourselves, “3/4 is 2/3 of what size?” Note the <strong>diagram</strong> below that will assist us in making the connection between partitive division and the invert and multiply rule. We see that the diagram is divided equally into three parts. Two of those parts are labeled with the original amount, 3/4. We can use these two parts to find the value of all three parts, or the missing size</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R8Brp36lyFtTu8kSIdPaag.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Again, we can rely on unit form to determine the size. We know that 2 units out of 3 is equal to 3/4. We also know that we need to know how many 3 units are. Let’s start by figuring out the value of one unit.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*USajjVrkCa1Neq-EHJEZsA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>What can we conclude from this development?</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1oK713pB3AVVnEGGFdgRtQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><em>This blog post was written by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekasilvamath?fref=ts' title='' rel=''>Erika Silva</a> a </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial?fref=nf' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a> <em>writer for grades 6–8.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:34.173368	2015-08-03 15:00:47.722859	<h4>FAQ Response</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Recently during a national mathematics conference, I posed the question, “How many of us understand the difference between partitive and measurement division?” Out of the 165 participants in the room, only two participants raised their hand.

14	3	Problem Solving the RDW Way	Strategies	2015-05-05 17:58:50	b21589b9d281	<h4>Strategy</h4>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*WlIHOHzAtljvpIe9woKEaQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">This is an actual image of student work from a Eureka Math classroom.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>What do you see when you look at this student’s work? I see a student who draws and labels models to reason abstractly and quantitatively about the relationships in the problem; who attends to precision in modeling and solving the equation. In other words, I see the end result of teaching a systematic approach to problem solving, what we refer to as “Read, Draw, Write,” or RDW.</p>\n<p>When faced with story problems young children will often arbitrarily add whatever numbers they see. The RDW process short-circuits this impulse by giving students tools to think about and model the relationships presented in a given situation. This enables them to solve problems accurately.</p>\n<p>In this process, we ask students to read the problem and think about what information is given. Do we know the <strong>whole</strong> and one <strong>part</strong>, in which case we can subtract or count on to find the <strong>missing part</strong></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*REjfuHl53pLZ5KN3s19kgg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Or do we know the <strong>parts</strong>, in which case we put the parts together to find the <strong>whole</strong>, or total</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*zI15O1bR5C33t1Gz1nvsGw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This work with the part-whole relationship helps students make sense of the problem.</p>\n<p>Next, students draw a model to represent the information. The two models used most often to show the part-whole relationship are the number bond and the tape diagram.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*KZHl7-Z2E8AFoF4JRv36hA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>In the problem pictured, Precious chose to use the tape diagram. In the first part of the problem, she draws and labels the longer bar with <strong>M</strong> for Milan, and 35 for the quantity. She draws and labels a shorter bar with <strong>R</strong> for Rene, and the question mark to indicate the unknown. She labels the part she knows as 16. This model helps her see that she knows the whole and one part, so she knows she can subtract. She uses the chip model to support her work with the subtraction algorithm</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*zV6mjcHb92CJ8VoS36UE-Q.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>In the second part of the problem, Precious again uses the tape diagram to show the relationship of the numbers, but this time she chooses to use a different strategy to subtract, arrow notation. In both parts, Precious could have counted on or she could have used compensation. These are other strategies she has learned in <em>Eureka Math</em></p>\n<p>This student’s work shows detailed, specific choices rather than arbitrary combinations of numbers. It also shows flexible thinking.

15	3	Analyzing Student Work	Strategy	2015-04-21 13:30:38	13ff6a3713cc	<h4>Strategy</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although analyzing student work isn’t always easy, the benefits are invaluable. By studying our students’ approach to solving problems, we can discover new ways to teach a familiar topic, learn more about a particular child’s strengths and weaknesses, and plan modifications or adjustments in our current instruction.</p>\n<p>Let’s walk through a student’s solution to Problem 4 of the Problem Set of Grade 5, Module 3, Lesson 15:</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*AJsuN8ILZyqtNNGRnoGwvQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">This problem is taken from Eureka Math, Grade 5, Module 3, Lesson 15.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*jI6xoNy8tu5NWuRlOgBFig.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>The student drew a tape diagram. She knew to label the whole as 20 minutes, parts 1 and 2 with the number of minutes Gavin spent on those questions, and part 3 with a “?” to represent the unknown</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*klVxoQbGZG4Ktd7O4y0ZkA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Step 1</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The tape diagram helped her decide to subtract the amount of time Gavin spent on questions 1 and 2 from the total time spent on the quiz</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*EadPCvUUkXn2Nss-nwSFwA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Step 2</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Common units were formed and 20 was renamed. The student recognized the need for common units in this subtraction problem and was able to correctly determine the equivalent fractions. Why was the value of 20 renamed? She recognized that it would be too challenging to subtract the mixed fractions from 20, so 20 was decomposed into 19 and 1. The number 1 was renamed 20/20. Now, she is able to subtract</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*BN7ZMFBxVurq9Rz6TSzLaA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Step 3</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The student subtracted the first two mixed numbers in <em>step 3</em>. To do so, she first subtracted whole numbers, 19 and 9, to get a value of 10 and then subtracted the fractions to find a difference. Finally, she added 10 and 5/20</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*h9kT6zGu_Mom3mgEuckVXQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Step 4</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Because there weren’t enough twentieths in 5/20 to subtract 16/20, she unbundled a 1 to make 9 and 20/20, which became 9 25/20 when she added 5/20</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*42dxVEH4Pjh76RgZkpwEAA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Step 5</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After subtracting the two mixed numbers in <em>step 5</em> the student remembered the answer needed to be written in minutes and seconds. She knew there are 60 seconds in a minute. Renaming the fraction as sixtieths made it easier to determine the final answer, which she wrote as a statement: <em>Gavin had 6 minutes 27 seconds for question 3</em></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*XY0UEQ0ZIVnASxEFRM3DqA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Step 6</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>In analyzing this work and breaking down what this student was thinking in each part of the solution, we learned more about the knowledge and skills needed to successfully answer this problem. This student needed to know how to apply the “Read, Draw, Write” process, rename units, subtract mixed numbers, rename a fraction greater than one, and decompose or unbundle units in a way that simplifies problem solving. The analysis here helps us anticipate where a student might get held up and allows us to customize our lessons to fit the needs of our students.</p>\n<p>Looking at these steps also reveals alternative ways to solve the same problem, such as the following:</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*RYllwEiDGZZRRo8GZoARvQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Alternative solution to Problem 4.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Although many of the steps in this alternate approach are the same as the steps detailed above, the strategy is different. Encouraging and accepting multiple strategies is a wonderful practice to incorporate into your math classroom because it addresses different learning styles. It also allows students to create their own strategy, which increases motivation to solve problems and strengthens their mathematical thinking when asked to explain or justify their work. Celebrating multiple solutions in our classrooms also creates a sense of excitement and fosters positive feelings toward math.</p>\n<p>Planning the time to analyze student work has major impacts on our instruction and the success of our students. This can also be a great exercise to do in collaboration with colleagues. You may gain a different perspective, discover new ideas, and even increase your own understanding of mathematics.</p>\n<p><em>This post is by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dawn-Pensack-Eureka-Math-Grades-5-6/1628157847414042' title='' rel=''>Dawn Pensack</a> who is a Grades 5–6 </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a><em> writer.

However, we spent the two previous years focusing deeply on the eight <a href='http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/' title='' rel=''>Standards for Mathematical Practice</a> and the progressions across grade levels. This provided a strong foundation for delivering the new<a href='http://www.pdesas.org/standard/pacore' title='' rel=''>PA [Pennsylvania] Core Standards</a></p>\n<p>Extraordinary professional development was provided for our elementary teachers in June and then again in October. Our staff had the unique opportunity to work with veteran teachers who were on the team of writers for <em>A Story of Units</em>. Support, training, and grade-level collaboratives have continued throughout the school year</p>\n<p>We are the first district in Pennsylvania to implement <em>Eureka Math</em>, so it was truly a leap of faith. Recently, we hosted a neighboring district to observe Eureka in action. They were “blown away, awed” by the high level of mathematical student discourse and cognitively engaging tasks</p>\n<p><strong>What are you hearing from teachers?</strong></p>\n<p>As with any new program, there was a learning curve for students, parents, and even teachers. In the beginning everyone struggled with new vocabulary, the multiple models, and the sheer rigor of the program. Through the growing pains we realized productive struggle is necessary for learning.</p>\n<p>Our teachers put in a remarkable amount of time and effort and now there are so many “aha” or “eureka” moments happening daily in their classrooms. Teachers and students alike are uncovering the “why” behind the math. Collegial math discussions abound. Teachers are collaborating in countless and creative ways across the district. Several of our 3rd and 4th grade teachers are even piloting <a href='http://www.zearn.org/screencast' title='' rel=''>Zearn</a>, a digital Eureka platform that supports a blended approach to learning</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve hosted parent nights in your district and worked to help parents understand the new approach to teaching math. Has that been well received?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, we tried to be proactive from the very start, releasing an introductory letter and video over the summer. Almost 700 hundred parents attended the parent math nights offered in early September at each of the four elementary buildings. The majority of parents were receptive and appreciative. There were a few who were resistant to change, or had political agendas.</p>\n<p>Frustration with homework has eased with the support of various school websites from across the country. During recent parent-teacher conferences, parents confessed, “I’m not sure I should be saying this, but I love the new math.” Learning support teachers [who assist struggling learners] are seeing success with their students due to the multiple ways to model a math problem, and at Gifted Individualized Education Plan meetings parents are thankful their children are being challenged.</p>\n<p><strong>In general, how do you feel about the direction of math instruction in our country?</strong></p>\n<p>I am passionate about math education and feel so positive about it right now. Our children need to know how to think, make sense of math, and persevere. And that is exactly what is happening with <em>Eureka Math</em>. It’s an exciting and exhilarating time for math in Upper Dublin and across the country</p>	2015-07-09 05:00:44.351378	2015-08-24 11:00:36.258364	<h4><strong>Janet Blenheim — </strong><em>K-5 Math Coach, Upper Dublin School District</em></h4>\n<p><em>Janet Blenheim is a K–5 math coach in the Upper Dublin School District, outside of Philadelphia.

Moment</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>In my 10 years as a 7th and 8th grade teacher, I never once saw a tape diagram. I was hesitant to use this model, but as I began to really study tape diagrams, and got the chance to use it with students of all ages I was amazed at its simplicity and beauty. Tape diagrams can help students break down word problems by allowing them to write an equation or number sentence to represent the situation.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some examples of just how meaningful a tape diagram can be in your classroom. Imagine your 5th grade students solving this problem without a model:</p>\n<><strong>There are 32 students in a class. Of the class, 3/8 bring their own lunch. How many students bring their lunch?\n(</strong><em>Grade 5, Module 4, Lesson 6)</em></>\n<p>If this fraction were a friendly or familiar fraction such as, ½ or ¼, students would typically have used mental math and been successful at solving this problem. But when faced with a fraction such as 3/8, students generally rely on remembering an algorithm or look for key words to determine which operation to use. Alternatively, a tape diagram allows students to visualize the problem and develop their strategy. Using a tape diagram, students can draw a picture showing 3/8 of 32.</p>\n<p><em>They start by drawing a model and partitioning it into 8 equal-sized sections because the unit here is eighths. The whole represents 32.</em></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*MZDfPHXjP_A6aWqXP7n4JA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Tape diagrams can also help students to see the difference between this 5th grade question asking students to multiply by a fraction and this 6th grade question asking students to divide a fraction by a whole number. They even help students divide fractions by fractions later on in Grade 6 Module 2.</p>\n<><strong>3/5 pint of juice is poured equally into 6 glasses. How much juice is in each glass?\n</strong><em>(Grade 6, Module 2, Lesson 1)</em></>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*80_CTYRHG-Gv3Q5Du2kTLQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>1/10 pint of juice is in each glass.</p>\n<p>The beauty of the tape diagram is that students will not be memorizing rules that they don’t understand. A memorized rule can’t help a student if they don’t remember how to use it or how to apply it to different scenarios. On the other hand, tape diagrams are universal visual tools, which allow students to better understand a problem. By using them, they can become more efficient problem-solvers and eventually solve without drawing a model at all.</p>\n<p><em>Be sure to check back next month as we continue the discussion of tape diagrams and their use in solving algebraic equations.</em></p>\n<p><em>The author of this post is Grade 6 & 7 </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a><em> writer, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/debbygrawn.eurekamath?fref=ts' title='' rel=''>Debby Grawn</a>.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:40.916003	2015-07-31 15:00:47.311328	<h3>(Part 1)</h3>\n<h4>Aha!

Around 25% of our students are English Language Learners who come from Spanish speaking households. These translations are part of the effort of making instruction accessible to all students.</p>\n<p>We started using the EngageNY (<em>Eureka Math</em>) from its inception in 2013. The first year brought with it steep learning curves. However, as the year progressed teachers felt they grew professionally and noticed a continual growth in student mastery of mathematics. Everyone involved in the adoption of the curriculum at Port Chester from myself to the principals, teachers, parents, and students have been critical in making implementation successful. Our efforts included setting up Eureka PD, interacting with writers, participating in NTIs, but it didn’t’ stop there</p>\n<p>Our teachers really needed Spanish translations of student material. Since these resources weren’t available at the time, we took the initiative to translate them ourselves. We started by enlisting professional translation services to assist with this project. Because these were literal translations, our teachers found that the key mathematical terms were often lost or confused. In response, we recruited a group of bilingual teachers to review the translations and ensure the content was clear and coherent.</p>\n<p>Since then, we’ve completed translating all of the student materials for Grades K-5. These translations have not only been beneficial to our district, but have become a useful resource for districts across the country.

23	3	Using Context to Understand the Rational Number System	Strategy	2015-05-08 21:11:46	eab557dd0942	<h2>Using Context to Understand the Rational Number System</h2>\n<h4>Strategy</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>The introduction of the rational numbers in Grade 6 requires that we broaden our outlook on the number line when making comparisons of numbers and quantities. Simply explaining to students that the numbers to the left of zero are negative values is not enough to develop true understanding of why these numbers are mathematically necessary. In our world we experience applications of the number line on both sides of zero, and these applications will aid our students in understanding what those negative values represent and how we can use them mathematically.</p>\n<p>Ordering magnitudes, for a sixth grade student, is really nothing new once the magnitudes have been meaningfully determined. They have previously compared numbers and quantities by their magnitudes as those numbers and quantities represented very specific contexts, such as the number of different animals in the zoo, or the heights of their classmates. However, in many real-world and mathematical situations, comparison of magnitudes is insufficient. For example, let’s compare deposits into an account; if we compare the magnitudes of these deposits we will find the greatest deposit made. Similarly, we can compare withdrawals made from an account; if we compare the magnitudes of these withdrawals we will find the greatest withdrawal from the account. If we look at the overall history of account transactions and compare their magnitudes, we can find the greatest transaction; however, it will not provide us with the most favorable transaction. This is because the actions of depositing and withdrawing money have opposite effects on the account balance. Deposits live on the positive side of the number line and withdrawals live on the negative side. It is for this reason that in such situations, we must instead compare numbers via their positions along the entire number line, not just to one side of zero in the case of comparing magnitudes.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*QTX0qD9DCLNiQ-o2ckMQBw.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Here is problem that exemplifies this instance from Grade 6 Module 3, Lesson 2</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>There are countless applications involving numbers on both halves of the number line. There are also countless applications of comparing magnitudes where the numbers coexist on one-half of a number line. It is the context of the situation that helps us to determine which of these two outlooks is more appropriate. For instance, we can compare depths of objects below sea level using magnitude since each object is described as being a given distance, which must be positive, below sea level. How would we describe the <em>depth</em> of a position on a dock that lies above sea level? If I describe such a position as being <em>x </em>feet above sea level, I’ve created a new context by changing the description to <em>above sea level </em>which requires a distinct new number line. It is often more useful in this situation to consider the elevations of the given objects with a set reference point at sea level. In this case, the objects are considered as positions along the number line with a fixed reference point of zero. The sign of the number representing the elevation of an object determines whether the object is positioned above or below that reference point. Absolute value tells us exactly how far the number is from the reference point; however it is the sign of the number that sets our description of the number’s position in reference to zero. What is important for us to realize is that the context of a situation assigns direction to the quantities involved, and that direction may not always be the same</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*iCRsHXZqrbgSa9jU-c0Jzg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Here is problem that exemplifies this instance from Grade 6 Module 3, Lesson 2</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Consider a football coach who is comparing his plays from a game and which of them are more effective than others. If the coach is focused on his offense, he considers the plays which yield the greatest gains in yardage as favorable, but not every play will result in a gain. Sometimes the offensive team is pushed in the opposite direction. A play that yields a 7-yard gain is far more favorable than a play resulting in a 7-yard loss. However, there is great meaning in both of these plays to the coach however. The number representing it on the number line is what provides that meaning. Being able to compare forward motion of the plays along the number line not only helps him to see which plays are effective, but also shows him which plays are not unfolding as they were designed. If the coach is focused on his defense, then he should take the opposite outlook on those numbers since a 7-yard gain from the opposing team’s offense is instead a 7-yard loss by his defense.</p>\n<p>Going one step further, sports commentators often provide viewers with an <em>average yards per play</em> statistic for a team’s offense in a given time period. Is this statistic calculated by magnitudes only? Do the statisticians insert the descriptions of <em>gain</em> and <em>loss</em> into the calculation? Of course not. Using both sides of the number line is what provides the most accurate statistic about a team’s offensive capabilitie</p>\n<p>Before any discussion about using operations with signed numbers, it is important that students are fluent in understanding how to represent quantities in given situations using signed numbers. They should be able to accurately locate those numbers along the number line, use the locations of those numbers on the number line for comparison, and be able to contextualize such a comparison to make meaning from the mathematical model.</p>\n<p><em>This is a post by </em>Eureka Math<em> team members <a href='https://www.facebook.com/1Beau.Bailey?fref=ts' title='' rel=''>Beau Bailey</a>, writer for Grades 6, 7, & 10, and <a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekasilvamath?fref=ts' title='' rel=''>Erika Silva</a>, writer for Grades 6–8.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:40.15333	2015-07-31 19:00:46.314096	<h4>Strategy</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>The introduction of the rational numbers in Grade 6 requires that we broaden our outlook on the number line when making comparisons of numbers and quantities.

20	3	Teachers are Lifelong Students	Aha!Moment	2015-05-18 14:43:08	5bce02184cad	<h4>Aha!Moment</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>My favorite part of being on the <em>Eureka Math</em> team is our culture of continuous learning. The team readily considers and discusses thoughtful questions, which leaves room to be a learner as well as a teacher. Working in a culture that assumes we all have a lot to learn means that I am not afraid to ask questions<strong> </strong>— I ask a lot of questions</p>\n<p>Recently, I saw an online Rekenrek demonstration video created by a well-meaning educator. As I watched something felt odd and it took me a minute to identify the reason. The video is shot from a student’s perspective; students are moving beads to the right as they counted while the rest of the beads are stored on the left.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8X53mjg0uD18lBdDXm_k2Q.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Note that we want students to see 4, shown on top right.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>“Aha!” I thought<strong>,</strong> “The beads are moving the wrong way.” Then I stopped to think about why that felt wrong.<strong> </strong>Was I being too rigid in my thinking? We want students to think flexibly about numbers. Time to ask my teammates with fluency expertise</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s what the team had to say about why we always move the Rekenrek beads from right to left from the student perspective:</strong></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*GXsdTBcJrEUxmS29T4Qrqw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Note that we want students to see 4, as shown on the top left.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The answer to this question lies in the number line and English print conventions<strong> (</strong>reading left to right<strong>)</strong>. We most often see the number line (or number path in GPK-1) increasing in quantity from left to right. This follows the print conventions children internalize in their early literacy work</p>\n<p>Students and teachers tend to generalize the left-to-right directionality to the Rekenrek. Look at the top image<strong>s</strong>. Where does your eye land first? Probably the top left. As a result, the quantity shown in the first image may be misinterpreted as 16 (6 on top and 10 on bottom). The second image<strong> is</strong> easier to see and count the four red beads<strong> </strong>because it corresponds to English print conventions</p>\n<p>When we are doing Rekenrek work, our purpose is often to quickly recognize and manipulate numbers. The fastest, easiest way for students to do that is by seeing the beads they should count in the top left of the Rekenrek. The point isn’t that the top image doesn’t show 4<strong> </strong>— it does. It just isn’t the most efficient configuration for students</p>\n<p>Directionality also has implications for negative numbers in middle school. When we teach negative numbers in Eureka Math, we introduce them as opposites of positive numbers. More specifically, a number’s opposite is one that is positioned at exactly the opposite distance from zero. Most often, negative numbers are positioned to the left of zero and positive numbers to the right. We move left on the number line to find a positive number’s opposite (or negative number) and we move to the right in order to determine which numbers are greater. Is that the only possibility? No. We also use the vertical number line. However, you’ll be hard pressed to find number lines that have positive numbers increasing to the left and negative numbers decreasing to the right.</p>\n<p><strong>Implications for Practice</strong></p>\n<p>I find that it is easy to confuse the direction beads are moving when I hold the Rekenrek in front of me because my view is the opposite of what my students see. I worked through this by deliberately practicing Rekenrek exercises in front of a mirror. Better yet — find another inquisitive mind and practice in front of one another! The feedback you get from 5 minutes of practice with a colleague can make a significant difference in clarity and pacing in the classroom.</p>\n<p><em>This post is authored by<a href='https://www.facebook.com/kateaustineurekamath?fref=ts' title='' rel=''> Kate McGill Austin</a> a </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a><em> writer for PreK and Grade K.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:37.979045	2015-08-03 09:00:47.720007	<h4>Aha!Moment</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>My favorite part of being on the <em>Eureka Math</em> team is our culture of continuous learning.

19	3	So you’re saying we should teach congruence and similarity before teaching slope?	From the Field — NCTM 2015	2015-05-18 14:43:26	ad7004480c57	<h4>From the Field — <em>NCTM 2015</em></h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>This was a question was posed at the end of my session, “Learning Slope via Rate not Rote,” at this year’s NCTM. I wasn’t sure if I should jump for joy or shed a tear. It was obvious from the question that my presentation made sense to the person asking. “YES! Absolutely teach these geometry concepts before introducing the concept of slope to students” was my response. The person that asked was just making sure she heard the message correctly, and I appreciated her for that.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*ZF1KuhPwNth4CUnvTpkyig.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Slide from the “Learning Slope via Rate not Rote” presentation at NCTM.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>What made me want to shed a tear was the fact that the question needed to be asked at all. The CCSS-M for Grade 8 requires students to use similar triangles to explain why the slope between any two distinct points on a non-vertical line in the coordinate plane is <em>m. </em>Further, students are expected to derive the equations <em>y = mx </em>and <em>mx + b.</em> Traditionally, students memorized the slope formula and the equations <em>y = mx </em>and <em>y = mx + b. </em>This is the rote learning I am referring to in the title of my session. Many teachers, myself included, taught this way and were flummoxed by assessment results. What do you mean my students didn’t score well on slope problems? They are so easy! All students need to do is plug in some coordinates and do the math, or simply draw the slope triangle and count. Test results made it obvious that rote learning is not the best way to go</p>\n<p>Learning slope via rate requires students to know about ratios, equivalent ratios, constant of proportionality, and most importantly properties of similar triangles. Specifically that similar triangles have corresponding sides that are equal with respect to the values of their ratios. That is, if two pairs of corresponding sides of similar triangles are <em>R’ Q’: RQ </em>and <em>P’ Q’ : PQ, </em>then we would expect</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*kLXkLLhEuZ--dXcEVn1G0w.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*f8m8FNo0dEP1Eciabt7B4g.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*9XLwA7wtFa8ON9tZjdnKDg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Further, if the given sides represent the similar right triangles drawn from a line on the coordinate plane, the value of the ratio is the slope of the line! Once this is understood completely, deriving the equation <em>y = mx </em>is simple, and with an understanding of basic rigid motions, <em>y = mx + b </em>is just a translation of <em>y = mx, b</em>, units along the <em>y</em>-axis</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*YbuWqLR2pJrlMTF4GvK-9A.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>To the woman that asked the question,<strong> ‘</strong>So you’re saying we should teach congruence and similarity before teaching slope?’ I say thank you. You articulated the objective of the session with a single question. As teachers we need to recognize the need for change, and make sense of how we are supposed to go about making the change.

I think it’s definitely made teachers step up their game. That’s not a bad thing. It’s okay to stretch. Of course like with anything new, next year will be even better. <em>Eureka Math</em> is giving kids that deep understanding, so that they are able to complete problems that probably last year they weren’t able to complete</p>\n<p>My daughter — she’s 8 — is in private school. Her school implemented Singapore math four years ago. I see a lot of similarities between the two curricula. They are conceptual, foster deeper learning, and some of their strategies are very similar. In her school, they had huge teacher pushback and parent pushback in the beginning. But now everybody has settled into things, and the kids and teachers are all doing well. And my daughter is great at math. She can add numbers and subtract numbers and figure things out in her head so fast. She has such great number sense, too. I’m hearing a lot of teachers here in our schools saying the same thing this year. They’re saying that their kids are doing amazing things.</p>\n<p><strong>How is this different from what you had in place in the past?</strong></p>\n<p>We didn’t have a district-wide curriculum before, so it’s good to now have something that everybody is using. In reality, the <em>Eureka Math</em>strategies and approach aren’t really that different from the strategies I learned to use when I was a third-grade teacher — a lot of them are just good, common sense teaching strategies. For example, as a teacher, I knew just teaching math facts wouldn’t have worked with my students. I had to teach them strategies to remember the math. You’ve got to explain things and show what they mean, and then you’ll get to deeper understanding with kids. You’ve got to be able to get them to relate to what you’re doing so they internalize it, so it means something to them</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any challenges that have come up in this first year of implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>We had a scripted reading program at one point in the district, and teachers were initially afraid this was going to be the math version of that. We had to explain that this is a tool. You don’t have to follow it word for word. We told them we want them teaching the strategies and using the problems laid out in the <em>Eureka Math</em> materials but that it’s okay to still be creative with this. We’re not trying to take away anyone’s creativity. Right now, I think the majority of our teachers understand that and are comfortable with the strategies</p>\n<p><strong>How are parents in your district responding to <em>Eureka Math</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>Every school was asked to do a parent night. The parents were very receptive to going and responded positively afterwards. Once an adult, an educator, sits down with parents and explains to them what we’re doing and why, instead of them getting their information on social media, parents are fine with it.</p>	2015-07-09 05:00:43.754078	2015-08-24 11:00:35.661573	<h4><strong>Anna Teekell — </strong><em>Curriculum Specialist, Rapides Parish</em></h4>

Rugg Elementary School in Alexandria, Louisiana. Sarah also serves as a lead math teacher at the district level, helping to provide professional development to her peers.</em></p>\n<p><strong>How is this first year with <em>Eureka Math</em> going?</strong></p>\n<p>So far it’s going really well. You’re going to have some bumps. This group of students I have this year went through multiple changes of curriculum and standards over the years, and that’s been a struggle. But with the strategies in Eureka, the kids have really done well.</p>\n<p>A large percentage of these kids are visual learners. All the modeling in <em>Eureka</em> is just really good for them. In other words, drawing things out for this group is so helpful. Many of them don’t really get it unless they can draw a picture, and <em>Eureka</em> asks for that. And by doing this, we show them there’s a meaning behind what we do, so when you get to the algorithm you can justify or explain it</p>\n<p>It’s always been intimidating for my students when I say, “Prove your work.” Now, they have a larger toolbox of strategies to do that with. If I say, “Hey, model this with a picture,” they’re not looking at me with a blank face.</p>\n<p><strong>In what other ways is <em>Eureka Math</em> different from other approaches you’ve used?</strong></p>\n<p>Kids need more than one strategy for solving problems, and then they can pick which one makes the most sense to them. In everything else (writing, reading, etc.), you’re giving kids multiple strategies. You should do that with math too. <em>Eureka </em>helps with that. This makes math more meaningful, too, and more relevant to life</p>\n<p>I think students have had tricks in the past, but they tended to expire by fifth grade. The strategies in <em>Eureka Math</em> can carry them into the upper grades. They’re going to be able to use tape diagrams in junior high. They’re a great visual aid to help a student map out a word problem. And area models can follow them going into high school</p>\n<p><strong>How is the transition going for the teachers you work with?</strong></p>\n<p>When we’re doing a lot of these trainings, it’s almost like some teachers are having a harder time than the students because they weren’t given a conceptual framework of learning in math as kids. But we definitely have teachers taking this curriculum and doing amazing things with it.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s different in the classroom this year, with <em>Eureka</em> in place?</strong></p>\n<p>They’re doing better with fractions than my students in the past. I think the manipulatives we use with <em>Eureka</em> help represent the number and show fractional parts, and there are many opportunities to draw them out, too</p>\n<p>We work more on relating the math to real life, too. For example, we were recently looking at a recipe for a meal, and we were adding up fractions. If we get the fractions wrong in cooking, kids understand it’s going to come out tasting like garbage. Math is in everything. And if we’re going to prepare these kids for careers and colleges — for jobs that pay really well and are going to be there when they get out of school — they’ll need really great math skills.</p>	2015-07-09 05:00:42.25951	2015-08-24 07:00:36.055304	<h4><strong>Sarah Jolly — </strong><em>5th Grade Math Teacher, L.S.

16	3	How Are We Studying Transformations Differently?	Aha! Moment	2015-04-21 19:00:06	4fe5ee2621d	<h4>Aha! Moment</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>If figures are <em>what</em> we study in mathematics, then transformations are <em>how</em> we relate them. Transformations are significant to the <em>Eureka Math</em> Geometry curriculum and to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), both of which approach transformations in a more purposeful way than before. What distinguishes how they were formerly studied versus how they are being studied now</p>\n<p>A look into most textbooks predating the CCSS reveals this distinction. Even by casual observation, there was heavy, if not constant, use of the coordinate plane in the chapter on transformations. A student would have seen rotations performed by a convenient 90, 180, or 270 degrees. Reflections were applied across the x or y axis and across the y = x or y = -x lines.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*gD9O7x_sy38GdrBPXmGQPA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>A set of specific transformations was previously studied so that each transformation in the set neatly mapped to easy-to-manage coordinates. A student might have gotten the impression that only a fixed number of possible transformations existed! In reality, transformations that map to not-so-easy-to-manage coordinates do exist: a reflection can be performed over any line, a rotation or a dilation can be performed about any point, and a translation can be performed along any vector.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*B30I6bUR33FWDrvrMcsEvg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">These images are taken from Eureka Math Grade 8, Module 2 in the free Module PDFs on eureka-math.org.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This broader perspective makes transformations abundant in the plane, as there are endless lines, points, and vectors to select from. <em>Eureka Math</em> introduces students to this flexibility with transformations before examining transformations in the coordinate plane, which do not enjoy the same kind of abundance</p>\n<p>Previously, the topic on transformations was treated as an isolated topic; a study of the transformations chapter had no impact on any other chapter in a textbook. Now, the way transformations are taught gives students the ability to manipulate figures in the plane freely, which sets the foundation for other areas of study, such as the verification of perpendicular segments, the derivation of the equation of a circle, and perhaps most notably, congruence and similarity.</p>\n<p><em>This post is by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathgeometry?fref=ts' title='' rel='nofollow'>Pia Mohsen</a>, a former teacher, who is a <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eureka-Math-Geometry/788314054589598' title='' rel=''>Grade 10</a> writer for the </em><a href='http://www.eureka-math.org' title='' rel='nofollow'>Eureka Math</a> <em>curriculum.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:31.827445	2015-08-03 15:00:45.686674	<h4>Aha!

He said, “Ms. LeBlanc, if I would have known math was this easy I would have liked it a long time ago.”</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><em>Em LeBlanc is the Principal of Park Elementary School, a Title I school in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, that starting using </em>Eureka Math<em> during the 2013–14 school year. Ms. LeBlanc is the district’s former elementary school math & science specialist and also previously taught 3rd grade.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What makes <em>Eureka Math</em> different from other approaches?</strong></p>\n<p>Eureka does not do tricks. For a lot of teachers and a lot of parents, or people of older generations, their teachers taught them tricks or rhymes or songs. So for multiplying fractions, they might use the butterfly method. That would help them remember a procedure, but there’s no math behind that and it doesn’t work every time. People were just remembering a trick, but then they would get frustrated when they couldn’t explain it, because they didn’t know the math.</p>\n<p>This is exactly why some parents can’t help their kids with math homework now. They didn’t learn to understand math. They can’t explain it to their kids.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the math instruction across grades look like in your school with Eureka?</strong></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*1pL0KaCccOiZ88kE.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The strategies are used coherently among grades. They’re not just one-hit wonders. You may learn about a number bond in kindergarten, but by fifth grade you’re applying that to fractions.</p>\n<p>There’s definitely a progression within a grade level and across grade levels with an emphasis on concrete, pictorial and abstract ideas. Usually when giving students concrete models, we use things like Unifix cubes, counters, or any kind of manipulative. Then we have them draw problems. Then they do the math in their head. It’s a progression.</p>\n<p><strong>How are your teachers doing with the transition to this curriculum?</strong></p>\n<p>The curriculum perfectly reflects the standards and the instructional shifts. You can’t get any better than that. The teachers, once they get familiar with it, they’re sold even if it’s a struggle sometimes at first.</p>\n<p>I had a group of retired teachers come back to teach this school year, and I had to train them. Once they got into <em>Eureka Math</em>, even though it was new to them, they loved it. They could see why it made sense. They liked how the curriculum was visual for the kids, but also that the students who were ready to move on to abstract problems could do that, too. I thought they might be resistant to something so different, but they weren’t</p>\n<p><strong>How do students like it?</strong></p>\n<p>I had a low-performing student last year when I was teaching. He raised his hand a lot, but you never knew what he’d say. One day he raised his hand, and I called on him. He said, “Ms. LeBlanc, if I would have known math was this easy I would have liked it a long time ago.” His math experiences prior to 3rd grade must have not been good because he turned off liking math. He shut down. He would have liked it those other years if he had had these successful experiences.</p>	2015-07-09 05:00:47.034343	2015-08-24 09:00:38.212823	<h4><strong>Em LeBlanc — </strong><em>Principal of Park Elementary School</em></h4>\n<p><em>Em LeBlanc is the Principal of Park Elementary School, a Title I school in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, that starting using </em>Eureka Math<em> during the 2013–14 school year.

7	3	What is the Exit Ticket?	Spotlight a Resource	2015-06-04 14:10:10	4550d6b861e	<h4>Spotlight a Resource</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Daily formative assessments, or Exit Tickets, are presented in every lesson in the <em>Eureka Math</em> curriculum to provide teachers with information about students’ mastery of topics. They provide quick glimpses of the day’s major learning for students and teachers. Through this routine, students grow accustomed to showing accountability for each day’s learning and they produce valuable data for the teacher that becomes an indispensable planning tool</p>\n<p>Exit Tickets do not require a grade because students are not expected to have mastered the topic they just learned in class the same day. Instead, the purpose is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of students individually and collectively. A quick glance at each student’s Exit Ticket immediately after they hand them in can provide enough information to evaluate a student’s level of understanding of the lesson taught that day. Based on this data, teachers are able to tailor subsequent lessons to meet the needs of their students individually and their class as a whole.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*R3T5QGwTxXHmQcSAT5ITCA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">By completing a spot check, the teacher realized that this student does not recognize the difference between equations and expressions. Also, it is unclear if this student completely understands part (c). The following lesson continues to focus on addition of rational numbers so the teacher can confidently move to the following lesson while intentionally focusing on these two areas.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>Addressing the Class Collectively</h4>\n<p>When the entire class struggles with the same concept, various strategies can be used in place of re-teaching. For example:</p>\n<li>a fluency could help close the gap.</li>\n<li>an opening exercise at the beginning of the next day’s lesson could address a misconception and may eliminate further misunderstandings.</li>\n<p>On the other hand, the class may show a strong understanding of the day’s new concept, indicating they’re ready to move on. In this case, the teacher can move to the next lesson with confidence that students are well prepared for greater complexity. These types of decisions can only be made if Exit Tickets are evaluated immediately after a lesson.</p>\n<h4>Addressing Individual Students</h4>\n<p>A number of different strategies can be used to address individual students’ struggles. The information students provide the teacher when completing Exit Tickets could do the following:</p>\n<li>help the teacher create groups for the next day’s lesson according to their performance on the Exit Tickets. You could provide time for students to talk through their mistakes and make corrections. Another option is to use mixed level groups throughout the lesson so students use each other as resources and learn from a peer.</li>\n<li>cold call or circle back to individuals that you know struggled with the Exit Ticket.</li>\n<li>make a point to provide these students with immediate feedback to eliminate further confusion.</li>\n<p>These are only a few suggestions for what you can do to address individual students and the class based on Exit Ticket performance. Ultimately, you know your class and students best to make appropriate decisions about how to meet their needs. In being responsive to Exit Tickets, you ensure that your students have a coherent understanding of topics across lessons and Modules.</p>\n<p><em>This post is authored by Krysta Gibbs, a writer for the Grades 6 and 7 </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a><em> curriculum.</em></p>	2015-07-09 05:00:20.536818	2015-08-06 21:00:29.871382	<h4>Spotlight a Resource</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Daily formative assessments, or Exit Tickets, are presented in every lesson in the <em>Eureka Math</em> curriculum to provide teachers with information about students’ mastery of topics.

This is the first year the district is using </em>Eureka Math<em>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>How did your district choose <em>Eureka Math</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>We did quite a bit of background research. We looked at different districts across the state and outside the state. What we found with many other resources was that they said they were Common Core-aligned, but when you looked a little deeper at the learning standards and then at the materials, we realized the depth of thinking wasn’t there.</p>\n<p><strong>How is implementation going so far?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s been an interesting transition. It’s such a drastic change, not only in the way students are doing math but what teachers are doing and need to know to teach math this way. It’s requiring a great deal of work on the part of the teachers. Teachers are going above and beyond.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of things going well. Our elementary school teachers are so very impressed with the depth of mathematical learning. They’re very impressed with the depth of conversation students are having about math. There are many opportunities for student-to-student talk that’s built into the curricular materials.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s different about <em>Eureka Math</em> and the new college- and career-ready standards compared to past approaches?</strong></p>\n<p>With the old focus on math facts, that was a goal in itself. That was the end point. The way the teachers are teaching this year, the focus is on really understanding how the numbers work. The number sense piece is huge. Of course you have to multiply, but the multiplication ends up being the tool you use to get there instead of being the end goal.</p>\n<p><strong>How are teachers using the many resources that come with <em>Eureka Math</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>Teachers are making professional decisions. This is not a scripted program. It is a curriculum. I know how a curriculum is written. It’s intentionally written with a wealth of resources. Teachers have to make professional decisions from the resources about what works best for the students in their classrooms.</p>	2015-07-09 05:00:47.73134	2015-08-24 13:00:50.65995	<h4><strong>Kathy Highfield — </strong><em>Coordinator of Curriculum and Staff Development for Holly Area Schools</em></h4>\n<p><em>Kathy Highfield is the Coordinator of Curriculum and Staff Development for Holly Area Schools, a rural school district in Oakland County</em></p>

I wanted to see teachers using Twitter. I was, at first, pessimistic as I thought to myself, <em>who would be on Twitter speaking on education that is saying things I don’t already hear when I go to PLN meetings in my area?</em> And if there were people, I thought that the pool of teachers, educators and those concerned with education would probably be so small that I would rarely learn anything new. I thought it would be a waste of my time. I have never been so wrong in my life</p>\n<p>Social media, specifically platforms like Twitter, have not only increased my awareness about certain movements in the educational world, but they have opened my eyes and ears to people who are changing the very profession that I work in. From Twitter, I’ve learned about new <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23flipclass&src=typd' title='' rel=''>teaching techniques</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TLAP&src=typd' title='' rel=''>strategies for classroom management</a>. I’ve questioned my own practices due to <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HipHopEd&src=typd' title='' rel=''>educational chats</a> that occur on a nightly basis. One hour of engaging in a chat on education feeds me more than a month’s worth of in-face meetings put on by my school board</p>\n<p>The reason in large part is due to the fact that these virtual platforms and meeting sites are 100 percent voluntary. The people chiming in are those educators that <em>want </em>to improve the practice in <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23educolor&src=typd' title='' rel=''>every way possible</a>. Instead of following an endless amount of television programs from the time they get off work until bed time, they commit part of their free time to investing back into the profession that pays their bills. This is the reason why there is so much (more) to be learned from our new professional learning networks</p>\n<p>These platforms not only increase the breadth of available professional learning that one can accomplish, they explode it. There is no subject off limits, no one particular thing that a teacher cannot find when surfing the channels of Twitter. Educational initiatives of tomorrow are being discussed, improved, and put into action in “the cloud” today. The cyber soldiers of education are consistent and diligent in their growth in order to ensure that we serve our students better.</p>\n<p>Without Twitter, sites like <a href='http://www.edutopia.org/' title='' rel=''>edutopia</a> and <a href='https://medium.com/synapse' title='' rel=''>the synapse</a>, we would be stuck in the mud with our wheels spinning. The educational world is too integral to continue to hinge it to traditional modes of communication. Staff meetings, TLNs, local meetings, and the such, are all integral to improving educational practice. But social platforms, places where I can connect to a teacher that works in the same city as me, another that works in Idaho, and another one that works in Australia, take it to another level. The ability to connect in such a vast manner, so we can all dialogue, share ideas, question each other and come together, is a move that only benefits teachers, educational practice and inevitably our students</p>\n<p>During the summer, aside from taking an additional professional course or reading a book on education, there is little to no learning going on for teachers. Yet we subconsciously expect our students to come back from their summer breaks better and smarter students. If you are not on Twitter yet, get with it. Engage with others who are invested in the same interests. Use these platforms as other tools to improve on your own skill. They won’t fail you. You can still follow your favorite celebrities if you’d like as well!</p>	2015-07-14 19:48:46.629428	2015-07-23 13:02:50.221736	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/1200/1*Zfeb2XnNZTKQc2P90yZlzA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>The New “Professional Learning Network”</h4>\n<p>A few months ago, I decided to join <a href='https://twitter.com/callmemrmorris' title='' rel=''>Twitter</a>, not in the hopes of hearing the latest thoughts from my</p>

But there is also plenty of hagiography, under the label, “Pro Army.” After all, the point of public affairs is to “tell the Soldier’s story.” In officialdom, those stories are often trite and formulaic. But in my blog world, they are compelling— dramatic, inspirational, and sometimes hilarious.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*YCjW0ZsTRNUx2-RKXiD_8Q.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>While “My Public Affairs” was good for about one entry a week during my first deployment, I found it was hard to deliver as reliably back on the homefront. Nevertheless, I doubled-down on the meager investment I had made, using the platform to think about teaching issues and comment on my military service as I continued my civilian career as a high school teacher and college instructor.</p>\n<p>Some of the posts take on a <a href='http://my-public-affairs.blogspot.com/2014/12/doesnt-it-just-make-sense.html' title='' rel=''>esoteric bent</a>, in line with an induction in the hallowed halls of post-modern, deconstructionist delve into the espitemological foundations of communication and organization that is a doctoral program</p>\n<p><a href='http://my-public-affairs.blogspot.com/search/label/Satire' title='' rel=''>Satire made its debut in 2014</a> following a rejection from the Duffel Blog.

This is the school’s second year using</em> Eureka Math<em>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>How is year two with <em>Eureka Math </em>going?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s much better this year. Students have a better understanding of the instructional strategies that Eureka uses, such as tape diagrams and number bonds, because of their exposure to them the previous year. They also understand the “why” behind these strategies.</p>\n<p>Last year, our teachers had to adjust to a different method of teaching. They were used to teaching math the way they learned math. There was a little pushback at first with teachers, but when they saw the students conceptualizing and not just learning an algorithm they loved the curriculum. Something I hear a lot from teachers is that they wished they had grown up learning math this way.</p>\n<p><strong>What looks different today in terms of math instruction in your school?</strong></p>\n<p>Students are thinking much more deeply about math instead of just experiencing rote learning. There is much more depth of knowledge and conceptualizing. Also, they’re learning to persevere. This curriculum requires a student to push through until they understand concepts.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you seeing early signs of success with Eureka implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. All of our teachers embraced <em>Eureka Math</em> so the transition into the second year was much easier. For example, our 1st-grade teachers taught the curriculum with fidelity last year and the 2nd-grade teachers have commented on their success because of that. That’s been a huge benefit for the students as they enter 2nd grade. Our 2nd-graders are multiplying with the help of the embedded fluencies in the curriculum</p>\n<p><strong>Are there things your teachers have come to learn over their experience with Eureka that might be helpful to others just getting started with the curriculum?</strong></p>\n<p>We learned that you can’t wait until the day of a lesson to review the lesson. We now have vertical lesson planning across grade levels. At these meetings, teachers discuss upcoming lessons, give each other teaching ideas, and clear up any possible misconceptions. We also learned that we need to pace our lessons appropriately and consolidate lessons when necessary. The curriculum gives you more than you need, so we had to learn to trim things when necessary.</p>	2015-07-09 05:00:48.330776	2015-08-24 13:00:51.386168	<h4>Jamie Carruth — Administrative Dean, Highland Elementary School</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Jamie Carruth is the Administrative Dean at Highland Elementary School, a Title I school in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

It has been building for a long time — unreported by the complicit liberal media — in the campuses and classrooms of our nation’s academic institutions, from the lowliest liberal arts college, to the most illustrious of the Ivy Leagues. It represents a clear and present danger to America’s future, and is on a scale so great that no right-thinking person could fail to be shocked by the magnitude.</p>\n<p>It is, of course, the robbery with malice aforethought perpetrated by 40 million current and former student thieves: the non-repayment of student loans.</p>\n<p>Deceitful students, eager to gain an advantage in the hyper-competitive US job market, are taking advantage of the generous nature of student loan companies like Sallie Mae and American Education Services, taking out hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans with no intention of paying them back within their lifetime.</p>\n<p>The combined national student loan debt stands at <em>$1.2</em> <em>trillion</em>. This cannot go on. That money could and should be going to back to these companies’ poor shareholders so they can stimulate the economy. How is money supposed to trickle down if it’s collecting in a stagnant pool of unpaid student debt</p>\n<p>Last year, the House of Representatives passed the eminently reasonable <em>Defending Investors in America’s Future</em> bill. Under the bill, indebted students would be registered in a <em>Student Labour Occupational Pool</em> jointly administered by the student loan companies. Student loan companies would recoup their investment by leasing the services of these <em>slops</em> to other companies, with the student free to leave once their debt (and reasonable interest and administrative overheads) had been paid</p>\n<p>Sadly, DIAF was defeated in the Senate, after weak-willed liberal supporters of welfare queens and the work-shy banded together to create a vicious campaign smearing the outsourcing of indebted student labour to third parties as “basically slavery”.</p>\n<p>Despite the vitriol and scurrilous lies of the Righteous Left, the core problem still needs solving. We have a moral obligation to do all we can to prevent student loan company insolvency.</p>\n<p>Recall how piracy destroyed the music industry. If DRM had been introduced sooner, we might still have the pleasure of listening to music as its creators intended, on CDs. Congress had the opportunity to act, but the DMCA was a day late and billions of dollars too short. We must learn from the past so that student loan companies do not go the way of EMI, Universal, BMG, and Sony.</p>\n<p>These students are <em>stealing</em> from our humble student loan companies. They take this money — not caring how they’ll make payments — and use it to acquire knowledge which cannot be taken back. It is, in point of fact, the literal theft of intellectual property</p>\n<p>But if we can’t stop people from bettering themselves, we can at least deny them the support of the institutions that they supposedly value.</p>\n<p>Next week, the House will take up <em>The Albert Lord Fair Education and Academic Repayments Act</em>, a vital piece of legislation that will discourage wanton student thieves. FEAR would establish a new mechanism — Degree Grade Withholding, or <em>degrading</em>. Under degrading, students would not be entitled to reveal their <em>Alma mater</em> or GPA at job interviews, on their résumé, or in any written correspondence, until they paid back, in full, the debt they owe society and the student loan companies</p>\n<p>Representations of one’s college in any written communication would be allowed only when accompanied by the notarised statement (<em>paid in full, with gratitude).</em> Verbal communication of one’s college and academic performance would be illegal. Attempting to avoid being degraded, or misrepresenting a college course as “completed” — regardless of academic status — would be a felony, punishable by imprisonment. Enforcement would be the responsibility of a new division in the Department of Commerce, the funding for which would come from a new tax on textbooks</p>\n<p>Under the scheme, benevolent student loan companies would hold students’ degrees in escrow, releasing and validating them only when the full balance of the loan is repaid (with reasonable interest and administrative overheads).</p>\n<p>In the interim, it is envisaged that student loan companies will find interesting ways to leverage this collateral. Indeed, degrading is likely to create many new possibilities in the kind of securities that have been all too rare since 2008. We foresee significant trading opportunities in novel instruments securitised by degrees held in escrow, like Credit Degree Swaps, Exchange Traded Student Futures, and Limited Access Options. These would give the student loan companies some way of monetising their investment in America.</p>\n<p>No one should be under any illusions about the predatory nature of the student loan crisis. This is a problem that affects everyone in America.</p>\n<p>Call your congressperson and senator today. Tell them to vote in favour of FEAR. Demand that delinquent students be degraded.</p>	2015-07-14 19:48:49.38784	2015-07-14 19:48:49.38784	<h4>A modest proposal</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is a crisis in America.

50	6	A Plea to Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone:\nDo No Harm	We are two faculty members and medical/mental health providers in the Department of Pediatrics at University of California, San Francisco…	2015-07-02 13:58:13	d1e75fad48c	<h2>A Plea to Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone:\nDo No Harm</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We are two faculty members and medical/mental health providers in the Department of Pediatrics at University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children’s Hospital, offering care to gender-nonconforming and transgender youth, and hoping religious institutions will support us in our work.</p>\n<p>Sadly, in our own back yard, our Catholic Archbishop is doing anything but. Speaking at a recent conference in Manhattan, Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone cast aspersion on the increasing categories of gender being “invented,” drawing laughter from his audience at the expense of the growing number of GLBTQ people trying to live their lives free from prejudice, rejection, and violence.</p>\n<p>Cordileone’s initial proposal for a teacher handbook is even more vitriolic, cast in language that could have devastating effects on our GLBTQ youth: only a marriage between a man and a woman in sanctified, “all extra-marital sexual relationships are gravely evil and…these include…homosexual relations”; homosexuals can reach perfection if they grapple with their “condition” before God “by the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace.” Ergo: GLBTQ students will be taught being who they are or going in search of a partner is an evil act, and a good dose of reparative therapy (a practice legally banned in California) will help them suppress unnatural tendencies and achieve spiritual perfection.</p>\n<p>If those weren’t enough microaggressions to deflate a youth’s sense of well-being and catapult them into depressed or suicidal states (a significant risk for GLBTQ youth), the handbook condemns contraception and the use of assisted reproductive technology, the very techniques GLBTQ individuals use for family-building. Lesson: unprotected sex that may lead to AIDS is a holier practice than sinful contraception; any GLBTQ person turning to assisted reproductive technology to become a loving parent will be engaging in immoral activities. Is this what we want to teach our children?</p>\n<>Reports have it that student and community outrage in response to the original handbook proposal has led to a reconsideration of the language that will be used in the final teacher handbook. Regrettably, vitriolic words previously spoken cannot easily be taken back, especially if retracted only under duress, so now the damage has already been done.</>\n<p>In a comment specifically targeted to transgender individuals, Cordileone, in his Manhattan speech, stated, “The clear biological fact is that a human being is born either male or female.”</p>\n<p>This simplistic statement flies in the face of scientific studies demonstrating that sometimes a person’s body and gender identity (inner sense of being male or female, or somewhere on a gender spectrum) don’t match. While Cordileone states that gender identities are being “invented,” compelling scientific evidence — hormonal, genetic, and neurologic — indicates strong biologic underpinnings to gender identity development. Core gender identity would appear to be biologically hard-wired just like sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>The larger challenges faced by transgender individuals come not from biologic variation (there are safe and effective medical treatments to bring body and gender identity into alignment), but from social systems that do not accept or understand these individuals. Doubters should be aware of a recent, rigorously carried out study demonstrating that a gender-affirming model of care for transgender persons results in a quality of life and sense of “well-being” that were equivalent or superior to that seen in age-matched controls form the general population.</p>\n<p>Whether in the classroom, in our offices, our religious institutions, or at home, practices that support rather than condemn our GLBTQ youth are for the good of all of us.</p>\n<p><strong>Diane Ehrensaft, PhD</strong><em>\nAssociate Professor of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children’s Hospital\nMental Health Director, Child and Adolescent Gender Center</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stephen M.

48	6	Building a Homeschool Library	Part 2	2015-07-14 00:12:14	7d8adc7219e6	<h2>Building a Homeschool Library</h2>\n<h3>Part 2</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>When building a rich library for this home education adventure, it helps to familiarize yourself with the best of children’s literature — those authors and illustrators with the depth and longevity that so much else depends upon.</p>\n<p>When my children were small, we went to the local library several times a week and hauled bags filled with treasure back to our lair. Anything that caught any eye was fair game — and with each of us in possession of a library card, the 25 book limit was hardly limiting. With piles next to each sofa and bed, on tables and desks, we whiled away many hours. This is how we fell in love, picked our favorites, saved our pennies, and built a library of our own.</p>\n<p>This list is the result of my effort to select a few of our favorite authors and illustrators. It is far from exhaustive, but these are the voices and visions that, I believe, no homeschool should be without.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. Roald Dahl</h3>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*78p2LwVWzmvmfnY0yuum1Q.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Dahl is like family, the goofy uncle who tells wild, vivid tales that make you laugh. Many of his stories are now part of the culture and have been made into film (<em>Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Witches</em>), but you would be missing some glorious fun if you skipped the books. His eccentric imagination and his flair for finding the humor and the horror in comic tragedy make each story a delicious romp. Dahl’s language and his names are tailor-made for children. He has given us poetry (<em>Revolting Rhymes</em>), autobiography (<em>Boy</em>), fantasy (<em>The Minpins</em>), and many stories distinctively Dahl (<em>The BFG, The Twits, George’s Marvelous Medicine</em>). This in addition to his wonderful writing for adults (another forum, perhaps). Dahl holds a place of honor on our shelves and is read by the whole family</p>\n<h3>2. Lloyd Alexander</h3>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*UTfdo2zT29KHPgIr4OiACg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><em>The Chronicles of Prydain</em> series is a great place to dive into Lloyd Alexander’s fantasy oeuvre. There is a warm, earthy quality to these tales that makes them more accessible than Tolkien, but no less thrilling. We find humor and whimsy alongside the grandeur and epic storytelling, making for memorable reading. <em>Time Cat, The Westmark Trilogy, The Iron Ring</em> — these and many more illustrate Alexander’s wonderful ability to weave history, mythology, and fantasy into an intriguing tapestry</p>\n<h3>3. Shel Silverstein</h3>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*kayrFfGnxJui4hkxhdyJaQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>A renaissance man of sorts, Silverstein was a writer, artist, musician, and songwriter (remember “Sylvia’s Mother”?) who has left treasure in his wake. His charming collection of, often, puerile poetry is a delight to readers of all ages. <em>A Light in the Attic</em> and <em>Where the Sidewalk Ends</em> display both his witty illustrative hand and his humorous and often moving way with words, while <em>The Giving Tree</em> is a provocative fable for all of us. Silverstein has managed to weave third-grade humor with meaning and intellect, creating lasting literature. His art conjures Jules Feiffer while his language could be a relative of Bill Watterson’s Calvin</p>\n<h3>4. Laura Ingalls Wilder</h3>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*_VRlyGijj0BbaGZz5aPj-g.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Famed and beloved for her <em>Little House</em> series, Wilder is probably not a new name to anyone reading this. Her clear-eyed depiction of a pioneer girl is brought to life by Garth Williams’ energetic illustrations. Laura’s day-to-day reality is somewhat exotic yet accessible to modern kids, making these books fun to read and educational. These stories inspire numerous projects — food, music, crafts and more, and have spawned many companion books. They also remind young people of the deprivation that came before our current era of plenty (for most) and, hopefully, encourage gratitude. (Interesting aside — it has been asserted that Laura’s daughter, Rose, was actually the main author of these books. Read <em>The Ghost in the Little House: A Life of Rose Wilder Lane</em>, by William Holtz.</p>\n<h3>5. Cynthia Rylant</h3>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*3kfriGM2IiLQ9J-OkyA1gQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Rylant has given us, along with a host of brilliant illustrators, a wealth of material from which to choose. From the Newberry winning novel, <em>Missing May</em>, to the autobiographical picture book, <em>When I Was Young in the Mountains </em>— from the charming <em>Thimbleberry Stories</em> to her many series (<em>Poppleton, Henry and Mudge, Mr. Putter and Tabby</em>, to name a few), Rylant is fabulously prolific and adept at finding the lovely notes in life. She gives us convincing and quirky animal characters as well as sympathetic young people grappling with all manner of real-world challenges. I know of few writers who so successfully navigate the worlds of fantasy and reality, alternately. Toddlers love her and will be reading her as teens — and I shall happily check in with Mr. Putter and Tabby for the rest of my life</p>\n<h3>6. Chris van Allsburg</h3>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*WFy50knctu10WCfRACjD5A.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>It’s difficult to say which of this author/illustrator’s formidable talents is the stronger. His stories are inventive and fascinating while his illustrations are gorgeously detailed. To have both story and art be so powerful is a rare thing and makes his books collectible. Three of them, <em>The Polar Express, Jumanji</em>, and <em>Zathura</em> have been adapted to film, with varying results. However, don’t miss the lesser known titles — <em>Two Bad Ants, The Widow’s Broom, The</em> <em>Wretched Stone</em>, and more. All of his stories quickly and nimbly create an irresistible atmosphere, allowing the reader to fall in. It’s always a pleasure for all ages</p>\n<h3>7. Dr. Seuss</h3>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*nfjHSB252-sSEmsvuF9fMQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Theodor Seuss Geisel is so much a part of the fabric of children’s literature, I almost didn’t include him here. It seemed too obvious. Upon reflection, however, I had to. Dr. Seuss has given us over 60 children’s books and a world of delight. He has shepherded countless youngsters into a life of reading with wit, rhyme, and a goofy spin on language. He encourages responsible stewardship of the planet, kindness in our relationships, and general joie de vivre. <em>The Cat in the Hat, the Grinch, the Whos, Horton, Sam-I-Am </em>— these iconic characters and many others will live on for generations to come, making Seuss’ books staples for all young readers</p>\n<h3>8. Graeme Base</h3>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*MA3G34wICRKXgPjQwOs8qA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Like Chris van Allsburg, Base is a superb illustrator who tells a mean story. His illustrations are lush and richly detailed, bolstering his imaginative storytelling. <em>Animalia</em> has become somewhat of a classic and, with its creative spin on the traditional alphabet book, has captured the attention of all ages. <em>The Eleventh Hour</em> and <em>The Sign of the Seahorse</em> show Base in fine author/illustrator form. I could recite passages from both, as I was asked to read them so often they became part of the fabric of our literary life. With prologue, two acts, epilogue, maps, music, rhyme and a cast list, <em>The Sign of the Seahorse</em> (with the campy subtitle, <em>“A Tale of Greed and High Adventure in Two Acts”</em>) makes grand fun of musical theatre and has been staged as an opera with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in Base’s native Australia. When read aloud, there is much opportunity for high drama, making Base a winning choice</p>\n<h3>9. E. B. White</h3>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*YA5_43EzsXe7Zvs3M70bUA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Impossible to ignore, White’s contribution to children’s literature is seemingly small, but invaluable. <em>Stuart Little, Charlotte’s Web, and The Trumpet of the Swan</em> represent the sum total of his juvenile offerings. They are, however, head and shoulders above most and have, rightfully, captivated generations of readers. He has also given us an updated version of Strunk’s classic writing manual, <em>The Elements of Style</em>, which comes in very handy when guiding young readers into the writing life. Add to this his wonderful body of essays, which delight and instruct teen readers as well as adults, and White is an author we should all have on our shelves</p>\n<h3>10. Jane Yolen</h3>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*cGFp5DFEVzwf9Y3OaGZ2yw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This award-winning author has been called the Hans Christian Andersen of America and the Aesop of the 20th century. With over 300 books to her credit, she has run the gamut of children’s literature with picture books (<em>Piggins</em> is a favorite), short stories, poetry, and novels (graphic and otherwise). She also gave us <em>Wizard’s Hall</em> — a novel about a boy named Henry who goes to wizard school where a dark wizard is trying to destroy the school — redheaded friend, pictures that move and speak. Sound familiar? And this years before J.K. Rowling penned her magnum opus. Yolen is impossible to dismiss. My kids especially loved the <em>Young Merlin</em> trilogy, but don’t stop there</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It’s difficult to conclude this list without a mention of others — Madeleine L’Engle, Dianna Wynne Jones, Maurice Sendak, C.S. Lewis — where to stop? There is such a wealth of literature, children’s and otherwise, just waiting. The more you sample, the richer your homeschooling journey will be — and it’s all such delicious fun, why not grab one today? And throw some at everyone around you, too — it’s good for them.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this originally appeared in Home Education Magazine.

46	6	Why Tenure Still Matters	upholding these protections enables a thriving marketplace of ideas	2015-07-14 18:24:59	7ea393f766a	<p><em>upholding these protections enables a thriving marketplace of ideas</em></p>\n<p>Scott, you impress me: winning three elections in four years, in a largely democratic state, including the only governor to withstand a recall vote. You’re also college degree-less, which is even more astounding (note: <a href='https://medium.com/@ev' title='' rel=''>my boss</a> is too). And even though I’m the step-son of a labor-leader fifth grade teacher and married to an academic, I’m still intrigued by you. I want the presidential candidates to force a real voting decision on me, for once in my life</p>\n<p>But when you say things like this, it gives me pause:</p>\n<>“Maybe it’s time for faculty and staff to start thinking about teaching more classes and doing more work.” — Scott Walker, quoted in <a href='http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/scott-walker-college-professor-tenure-120009.html#ixzz3fmvHudeF' title='' rel=''>Politico</a></>\n<p>You’ve made changes recently to the tenure system in Wisconsin that you say “give the state university system more flexibility and financial leverage.” According to Politico,</p>\n<>…the changes allow the University of Wisconsin system Board of Regents — 16 of whose 18 members are appointed by the governor — to set tenure policies instead of having tenure protections spelled out in state law.</>\n<p>More specifically:</p>\n<>“Regents can [now] fire faculty when they deem it necessary because a program has been discontinued or changed in other ways, not just when a financial emergency exists.”</>\n<p>So, to get this straight, political appointees can now shut down any program they wish and fire any professor they please at any time. Hmm. I wonder how the Political Science Department feels about this one, should they dare to cross the political views of the administration ever again. Or the <a href='http://journalism.wisc.edu/' title='' rel=''>Journalism Department</a>, lest their students conduct any investigative reporting on the Regents</p>\n<p>I understand the financial pressures, agree deeply in our need to both spend responsibly and reform the system of tenure. But the primary reason to modify tenure should be to fire ineffective or harmful professors, not to pull financial levers or reactively steer programs toward (politically or otherwise) popular topics. Leaving academic departments and posts open to the whims and popularity of political appointees — whether they’re ‘worthy’ of being kept within the budget — is short sighted.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/800/1*2zvkL9HBLLUEbPknQwjVmw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Worst case scenario, we could end up like this. Half-joking….</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>Tenure enables marketplaces of ideas to thrive</h4>\n<p>You want to give the state “financial leverage?” Enable a marketplace of research, ideas and free-thinkers to thrive. Systems that enable unfettered exploration, without fear of political reprisals or popular opinions, can make that happen. It attracts the most creative and forward-looking thinkers, and ultimately funding (public, foundation, and private sector) and jobs (of all kinds).</p>\n<p>Back to the quote at the top — that “faculty and staff [need to] to start thinking about teaching more classes and doing more work.” That statement demonstrates a disturbing oversimplification. It shines a light on the lack of understanding for what unfettered inquiry can deliver, and a misclassification of the value of faculty. And it likely won’t lead to better learning outcomes and make the system solvent.</p>\n<p>Even if you say “hey, we’re not repealing tenure, we just want flexibility,” that’s not the signal you’re sending. If I were a world-class academic, perhaps even one with potentially game-changing research under my hat, I’d be turning my eyes toward other state universities. Especially one with a governor who doesn’t tell me I should be working harder, because I already work my ass off.</p>\n<p>How might we be fiscally responsible without compromising unfettered inquiry and marketplaces of ideas? Eliminating tenure protection is not the answer.</p>	2015-07-14 19:48:45.392815	2015-07-23 23:01:22.602133	<p><em>upholding these protections enables a thriving marketplace of ideas</em></p>\n<p>Scott, you impress me: winning three elections in four years, in a largely democratic state, including the only governor to withstand a recall vote.

Here’s another answer for you…	2015-07-05 17:30:59	2d1bb7d81a6d	<h4>I have read a lot of stories on Medium about what Medium really is. Here’s another answer for you;</h4>\n<h4>IT’S EDUCATION</h4>\n<p>Medium is an educational tool. Medium is <em>not about writing </em>but about <em>feedback and discussion</em>. And right now Medium is probably the best and easiest tool for feedback and discussion on writings there is. Comments, highlights and responses is not an on/off feature. It’s the core of Medium</p>\n<p>If your look at research on feedback you see that it has quite an impact on learning for both the ones who write and the ones who give feedback.</p>\n<>“…producing feedback reviews engages students in multiple acts of evaluative judgement, both about the work of peers, and, through a reflective process, about their own work; that it involves them in both invoking and applying criteria to explain those judgements; and that it shifts control of feedback processes into students’ hands, a shift that can reduce their need for external feedback”</>\n<><a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2013.795518' title='' rel=''>Nicol, Thomson & Breslin. 2014</a></>\n<p>The more the students give and receive feedback the more they learn. Therefore we as teachers must ensure opportunities for peer feedback. That’s why I think Medium is such a great tool for education. You don’t write to write or read to read; you write to start a discussion, you read to participate in one. You use Medium to engage with other people.</p>\n<p>I recently read about an interesting blogging project at <a href='http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/05/27/why-blogging-is-key-to-the-future-of-higher-ed.aspx?m=1' title='' rel=''>Virginia Commonwealth University</a>. A great number of students where ask to do their writings on a blog platform and share and discuss via Twitter. This is a really interesting project because it makes students writings <em>public </em>thereby creating an place for peer feedback<em>.</em></p>\n<p>So bottom line is; <strong>Writing for peers improves the learning outcome for both the writer and the peers.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why Medium is the tool</h3>\n<p>When students do writings today they are likely using Word, Pages or Google Docs and export the final as a PDF.</p>\n<p><strong>But PDF has a few big disadvantage;</strong></p>\n<li>It’s basically a digital print format which means adding web content is a pain in the anchor.</li>\n<li>The one(s) who give feedback need a separate app for annotation, comments and highlight.</li>\n<li>It difficult to make the feedback public.</li>\n<li>It’s not responsive which makes it a pain to read on a mobile.</li>\n<p><strong>And Medium has a lot of advantage;</strong></p>\n<li>No need for separate app for annotation. You can highlight and comment directly in the story.</li>\n<li>You can write a longer response to any story.</li>\n<li>Rich media; Just paste in a link to a video, a webpage, a GIF, a ThingLink, a tweet, a soundcloud or whatever and you’ll (often) get a beautiful inline preview.</li>\n<li>Great and easy text editor. You can’t do it very wrong. It will look great on any device.</li>\n<li>It’s public by default but you have the option to make your story unlisted</li>\n<li>There is an app for iPhone, iPad and Android. Which mean you can read, write, comment, highlight and response from anywhere.</li>\n<>“One important way we learn is through expressing and articulating to others what we know or understand. In this process of self-expression, we construct an evolving understanding of increasing complexity. One aspect of this process is providing learners with opportunities to explore and articulate criteria and standards in the context of working on specific assessment tasks. In order to clarify notions of quality, learners need to analyse real, illustrative exemplars. This is where examining the work of peers offers meaningful opportunities for articulating discipline-specific knowledge, as well as criteria and standards.”</>\n<p>Liu and Carless, 2006 (<a href='http://web.edu.hku.hk/f/acadstaff/412/2006_Peer-feedback-The-learning-element-of-peer-assessment.pdf' title='' rel=''>Peer feedback: the learning element of peer assessment</a></p>\n<h3>Using Medium for education in 4 steps</h3>\n<p>The following will be a concept of Medium in teaching.</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Write on Medium</strong></h4>\n<p>Ask your students to write a story on Medium about a relevant subject. <em>You might ask them to add content such as a Thinglink which has an inline preview in Medium. Remember that the web is full of great content and tools. Make your students use them.</em></p>\n<></>\n<h4>2. Peer feedback during the writing proces</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ask your students to share their story with other students before publishing it. Either two-and-two or in smaller groups. In this way they can easily give feedback to each other during the writing proces (without worrying about different versions).</p>\n<h4>3. Feedback on the final story</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ask the students to publish their final story either as a public story (with the world) or unlisted (only with fellow students). Share the story with the rest of the class. Now it’s time for the students and the teacher(s) to give feedback and discuss through comments, highlights and responses. This is the essential part.</p>\n<h4>4. Teachers response on Medium</h4>\n<p>Optionally the teacher can give feedback via a response story. Again this response can be public or unlisted. But it’s important that the feedback is available for all students to read. Everybody benefits from feedback even though it’s not for or from you.</p>\n<h3>Una feature request, por favor</h3>\n<p>You can use Medium for education right of the box but I have one feature request that would make it just at bit easier. All I need is a <strong>Group feature</strong>. It would be like a publication but instead of the submission process the writers (students) would be able to add their story without any approval. The admin of the group would have the option to make the group either unlisted or public. So that only the writers added to the group would be able to read the stories (unless the writers themselves made their stories public</p>\n<p>That’s it. I really thing this is an exciting time for education. Not because of the technology itself but because of the opportunities they give us. All we need to do is see those opportunities.</p>\n<p>I just read a <a href='https://medium.com/art-science/technology-and-the-evolution-of-storytelling-d641d4a27116' title='' rel=''>story by John Lasseter</a> and I would like to end my story with a quote</p>\n<>“I remember when I first saw computer animation. It wasn’t being used for much at the time. It was really geometric, sterile and cold, but I was blown away by it. Not by what I was seeing, but the potential I saw in it.” John Lasseter</>\n<></>\n<p><em>(Remember that feedback on this story is only a highlight away)</em></p>\n<p><em>Edit: <a href='https://twitter.com/robinsongreig' title='' rel='nofollow'>Robinson Greig</a> published a similar story just earlier today.

What if you could let your loved ones borrow your services like you lend them your credit…	2015-09-16 14:01:02	78bc248aab0d	<h2>Wand Wants to Turn Messages Into Action</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h4>What if your apps could all talk to each other? What if you could let your loved ones borrow your services like you lend them your credit card? We’re about to find out.</h4>\n\n<p>Wand was not supposed to be a messaging app.</p>\n<p>As Vishal Sharma, the founder and CEO of Wand Labs explains, the app tries to address a key problem in the mobile realm: the dizzying profusion of mobile apps, and the paralysis this engenders. Back when the desktop ruled, there was a single comprehensible hub that provided access to unlimited content and activities — the browser. People typically used it with several tabs open and painlessly shifted from one task to the next. “But the minute we went to mobile, the browser failed,” he says. Living in a browser world was like residing in a contiguous continent. But now we live in a land of a thousand islands — those apps we keep installing — and keep hopping from one to another. And good luck if you try to share what’s inside one of those apps — in many cases even if your recipient is using the same app, he or she can’t do what you can, because your stuff is (understandably) protected with a password.</p>\n<p>Sharma hopes to fix all that with <a href='http://www.wandlabs.com/' title='' rel=''>Wand</a>. It’s kind of an uber-app, a hub designed to let you can access the powers and data in your personal mobile universe — kind of a browser of the phone. The name Wand implies that you’ll use the product like a sorcerer’s baton. The biggest magic will come when you use Wand to share the powers of your apps with friends and contacts; you can grant them access to the apps and even the services you subscribe to, even if they don’t have those apps or services on their own devices. If you send a Spotify playlist to a friend, say, she could hear the songs through Rdio or YouTube. (No copyright issues, since the recipients are playing it back on the services they’re authorized to use.) You could even grant people temporary access to your Wi-Fi network, DropCam, or Twitter account — without sharing the password</p>\n<p>Wand is still in private beta, but Sharma’s nine-person team will open it up to a broader audience later this year. What users will notice is that this new product — though originally conceived as a Siri-like personal assistant — looks, feels and operates like one of the messaging systems that they use all the time. Think Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Line, Snapchat, Slack or WeChat.</p>\n<p>Wand is entering this crowded field because messaging has suddenly become the dominant paradigm of the mobile world — the go-to place, just as the browser was in the desktop world. As one of the slides on the company’s pitch deck reads, “Messaging WILL eat the world.” Messaging is where the action is. And Wand hopes to transform messaging by making it actionable.</p>\n\n\n<p>Sharma’s resume is classic Silicon Valley. A bachelors degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, grad school in the US, a stint at McKinsey, jobs at big companies (Tandem, Sun) and startups (Ketera Systems), before the inevitable posting at Google, where IIT alumni include luminaries like search head Amit Singhal and CEO Sundar Pichai. Sharma joined in 2006.</p>\n<p>Early in Sharma’s tenure there, his uncle in India suffered a terrible accident that took his sight. Though Sharma was working in Google’s Ads organization, he was able to use his “20 percent” time (a benefit that, in theory at least, allows Googlers to work on projects of their choosing for one day a week) to devise “Jacob,” a voice-based digital assistant that would empower visually-impaired people. At the time, not all that much had been done with natural-language assistants on mobile phones. In one triumphant demo at Google’s Building 42, engineers were blown away when a tester asked Jacob about the weather, and the robot app asked him to specify the location before providing the accurate weather report. Still, Jacob was just one of countless obscure projects at Google whose coolness was not galvanizing the attention of higher-ups.</p>\n<p>That all changed in October 2011 when Apple introduced Siri. Google hastily set about developing its own conversational assistant, and Sharma was tapped as one of the leaders. Jacob’s technology helped in giving voice to the eventual product, Google Now. But Google Now diverged from Sharma’s vision — it focused on predicting what information people would want, as opposed to performing actions in the real world. “The vision was to do things, but we never built that,” says Sharma.</p>\n<p>In 2013, Sharma left his job and by the end of year was huddling with a small team (mostly brains drained from Google) to hash out a product that would fill what he saw as an increasing dysfunction in the mobile world.</p>\n<p>“We’ve taken a step back,” he says. “The wall on your iPhone and Android looks like MS Windows from years ago.” Every time you do something, he gripes, you have to install and then open one of those apps. Even worse, the information on those apps is not easily shared. You can’t cut and paste songs or contacts, or food dishes, from one app or service to another and expect it to behave in the same way.</p>\n<p>Wand addresses this problem by getting inside those apps, one by one, and decoding the information into a single format it can recognize. It does this by translating the information from all those weird formats into a single semantic language, a mobile-tech Rosetta Stone that tried to make everything interoperable with everything else. Once it completes the process, a virtual version of the app or service lives as a plug-in inside of Wand.</p>\n\n<p>This accomplishment enables Wand to conduct some clever tricks, some of which I have been trying as the first journalist to get extended access to the app. (Wand itself came out of stealth <a href='http://recode.net/2015/05/27/wand-aims-to-add-magic-touch-to-digital-sharing/' title='' rel=''>with a demo </a>at last May’s Code Conference.) Perhaps the clearest example comes from music apps. Using Wand, I was able to capture a song — “Kentucky Woman” — playing from a friend’s stereo via Wand’s Gracenote plug-in, even though I didn’t have the Gracenote app on my phone. From there, using other plug-ins already in the Wand universe, I could read the lyrics (Musixmatch), listen on Spotify, watch a music video of the song on YouTube, or buy it from Amazon. (There were other things in my testing that didn’t go so smoothly, but it <em>is</em> an early beta.</p>\n<p>In the parlance of Wand, an individual item of meaning — a song, a contact, a recipe item, a movie — is called an atom. Wand understands what it is regardless of what app it sprang from and enables you to take actions with it. In the case of a movie, you can peruse the cast in IMBD, watch a trailer on YouTube, check out the review on Rotten Tomatoes, or arrange a ticket on Fandango.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, you can share. By separating the <em>meaning</em> of these atoms from the app itself, Wand allows you to send those atoms to others. (For instance, I sent “Kentucky Woman” to a friend with Wand — and she could then perform all those actions I mentioned.) It also allows you to share your use of an app or service with others, granting the authority for a time period of your choosing. For instance, you can let a guest use your Wi-Fi account without letting them know the password. You simply choose the service and send it to someone, like a parent lending a credit card to a teenager. Only it’s easier to get it back</p>\n<p>For instance, I bestowed access to my Twitter account to my colleague, allowing her to post as if it was me. Fortunately she did not post a politically incorrect tweet that ended my career, but a <a href='https://twitter.com/StevenLevy/status/642412417180303360' title='' rel=''>more benign link </a>to a Medium post she’d edited. (Just to be sure, I quickly revoked her access afterward.</p>\n<p>Currently there are about thirty plug-ins that work with Wand, with the expectation of many more to come. (A glaring omission so far are financial apps like Square, Stripe or PayPal, but Sharma assures me that’s on the road map.) One I did not test was the Phillips Hue light bulb, as my lamps have yet to join the Internet. But it is obvious that the Wand app seems custom-made to tame what is already a complicated pile-up of digital gadgets on the so-called Internet of Things. It is universally recognized that so far the profusion of digitally connected applicances — a veritable<a href='http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/cambrian/burgess.html' title='' rel=''> Burgess Shale </a>of objects — generally don’t talk to each other. Wand promises to get inside all of them and make them speak the same language. Wand wants to give you the authority to share anything that you have access to — when you want and with whom you want, without revealing your password or compromising your security</p>\n<p>“We are looking at the Facebook of Things,” says Sharma. “When I’m sharing something with you, I’m friending your lights!”</p>\n\n\n<p>Something weird happened as Sharma and his team set about to implement their semantic breakdown of the app world’s Tower of Babel. Originally, Sharma’s concept was to order its actions in a stream, or feed, format. This was not a surprising choice since for several years <a href='http://www.wired.com/2014/04/perfect-facebook-feed/' title='' rel=''>the stream has been the dominant interface f</a>or top apps. (Examples include Twitter, the Facebook News Feed, and even the Yahoo Home Page, which got a bump in viewer response<a href='https://medium.com/backchannel/marissa-mayer-has-completed-step-one-71dc31912855' title='' rel=''> after switching to a feed in 2013</a>.) But once the Wand team realized that users needed some feedback when they shared their apps and services with someone (if only to acknowledge receipt), the door was opened for interaction. It started with simple thank you’s and grew to denser sharing and, eventually, bursts of personal chatter. Much in the way that complex systems are drawn to strange attractors, Wand’s engineers, dogfooding the test app, began to adopt what has lately become the most popular means of accessing one’s digital world — messaging</p>\n<p>“It’s like writing a novel,” says Sharma. “After you create a character, he or she wants to be something different. Originally we resisted it. But the product refused to be comprehensible until it became messaging.”</p>\n\n<p>While messaging makes Wand instantly compelling, Wand’s adoption of that paradigm also creates a massive obstacle. A messaging system works only if the people you want to message with are also on the service. While it’s the most friction-less thing in the world to give someone wi-fi access or an Uber ride if you are both Wand-erers (I officially make that a term), the friction is unbearable if one of you has to sign up at the moment the exchange must happen. Just look at Facebook to get a sense of how tough it can be to overcome that hurdle. In order to get critical mass for its messenger app, even the mighty Facebook had to clobber its users with a UX mace, denying them a key function of its flagship app until they got on their knees and downloaded the communications app. Obviously, Wand does not wield such coersive powers.</p>\n<p>But Sharma says that may not matter. Though he emphasizes that he wants Wand itself to be people’s go-to app, he also is speaking to other messaging companies about licensing the Wand technology. (He’s also turned down a few offers to sell his company.) Maybe, he muses, the Wand app will be the equivalent of what Google’s Nexus phones are to the Android system: a role-model made by the creator of a wider system. In this premise, Wand can show off its newest innovations and implement best practices on its own app. Meanwhile you might find its tech in products like Facebook Messenger, or Google Now, or even the as-yet unreleased personal assistant <a href='http://www.wired.com/2014/08/viv/' title='' rel=''>Viv</a>, created by the co-founders of Siri</p>\n<p>Like it or not, says Sharma, if those services want to perform Wand-like baton-waving — like giving password-free temporary access to Twitter or a Nest thermostat — they will have to come to Wand. Just last month Sharma and one of his ex-Google co-founders Elhum Amjadi were granted a patent on a “virtual assistant to remotely control external devices and selectively share control.” Another patent covers its semantic integration, the technology that enables it to allow all those apps to interact inside Wand.

133	8	How South Korea Squanders Its Fiber Advantage By Run-Amok Rote Learning	The US must emulate SKR’s Internet speeds and costs — but not its education system	2015-08-14 15:04:42	5c840c43a140	<h2><strong>How South Korea Squanders Its Fiber Advantage By Run-Amok Rote Learning</strong></h2>\n<h4>The US must emulate SKR’s Internet speeds and costs — but not its education system</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*RRj2nvLLI8kgtqGXFgrcTg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Earlier this month, on the same night, we saw a sad contrast. The last Daily Show with Jon Stewart aired. But by far the largest noise came from Donald Trump in the most-watched non-sports cable show in history.</p>\n<p>Yet I remain optimistic. I have faith that the American electorate will tire of the antics of “short-fingered vulgarian” Donald Trump before the primary season begins next year. (Spy Magazine came up with that epithet in January 1988; that magazine, sadly now defunct, was called <a href='http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/01/graydon-carter-donald-trump' title='' rel=''>“a piece of garbage” </a>by Mr. Trump. Glorious.) I have faith that <a href='http://nyti.ms/1JYG98k' title='' rel=''>tougher EPA rules</a> for American power plants will survive legal attack and allow us to hold up our end of the global bargain aimed at curbing disastrous climate change. And I have faith that Jon Stewart, who is the same age as I am, is just getting started</p>\n<p>What’s more, I have faith that Americans will be able to come up with many more interesting killer apps using high-capacity networks than South Koreans have. They may have the networks, but we have the freedom to create and fail.</p>\n<p>Ironically, our secret lies in not adopting some of the practices of their educational system — even though certain Americans point to those same practices with envy when the conversation turns to how we are falling behind.</p>\n<p>In one of my recent columns, I introduced Sun Woo Lee, a teenager from Seoul who goes to high school in New Hampshire and worked with me this summer. I asked her about the vaunted Korean education that pushes kids to take their studies so seriously.</p>\n<p>Here is Sun’s perspective: She feels bitter about the robotic, obsessive, physically exhausting practices of Korean schooling, and its quasi-religious insistence on multiple-choice testing based on the memorization of textbooks.</p>\n<p>Sun felt the full force of Korean educational aspirations as the only child of two devoted, well-educated, and well-resourced parents. Her parents moved several times within Seoul in order to help Sun’s asthma and get her slightly closer — fifteen minutes closer — to the schools she attended. Sun went to a private kindergarten where the kids were made to speak English at all times, including during recess. “English-only zone! No Korean!” Sun’s teachers said.</p>\n<p>That was fine with Sun, who soaked up the language; indeed, kindergarten was a good time for Sun. Not until after she left did her kindergarten decide to require the kids to memorize vocabulary words and give them daily quizzes. Sun avoided kindergarten-age stress.</p>\n<p>But elementary and middle school — another story altogether.</p>\n<p>In Seoul, private tutoring institutions, called <em>hagwons</em>, focus on standardized test-taking skills in every imaginable area. It’s not uncommon for students to go to multiple <em>hagwons</em> in a single day. In 2011, Time Magazine reported on police enforcement of a South Korean law prohibiting <em>hagwons</em> from operating after 10pm. “<a href='http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2094427-2,00.html' title='' rel=''>Teacher, Leave Those Kids Alone</a>,” is the title of the piece, which ends: “Then they [police inspectors] head home for the night, having temporarily liberated 40 teenagers out of 4 million.” Middle school classrooms often have standing desks in the back of the room. They’re there to keep sleep-deprived students awake during the day</p>\n<p>All of this is aimed at getting higher scores in multiple choice testing. Yes, just about all the tests are multiple choice, leaving no room for creative thought. Competitive Korean parents can’t deal with subjective grading, Sun says; she does not remember being graded on a paper, lab report, or any other self-produced work.</p>\n<p>Because so many students are expert at taking tests, in order to avoid grade inflation the test authors lean heavily on trickery aimed at luring students into choosing the wrong answer. “Koreans lose the ability to think for themselves in this type of education,” Sun says. Questioning or challenging what the textbook or teacher says is considered a waste of time.</p>\n<p>Indeed, hierarchical power relationships are so deeply embedded in Korean culture that challenging a teacher or any other older person is extraordinarily difficult.</p>\n<p>Dutch soccer coach Guus Hiddink, hired to work with South Korea’s national team in 2002, found that younger players were so respectful of older ones that they <a href='http://users.polisci.wisc.edu/schatzberg/ps616/Lee2007.pdf' title='' rel=''>wouldn’t make decisions for themselves</a>. They kept passing the ball to the older players. More tragically, the hundreds of students who died in the Sewol Ferry disaster of April 2014 stayed where they were because they were told to by a commanding voice over a loudspeaker</p>\n<p>Quitting a job to try a new career is frowned on. How could a company deal with an older person who is entitled to deference by virtue of his or her age, but is new at his or her job? It’s not just politeness that would make this gravely uncomfortable for the new company. The first question in a Korean conversation is often “How old are you?” and people immediately address one another altogether differently depending on age. Shame is also a major factor in Korean life, and changing jobs would imply failure.</p>\n<p>Sun still feels instinctively anxious when she takes a paper from a teacher with one hand — because Korean culture dictates that both hands be used and that the younger person bow. And it’s very difficult for her to know how to address a Korean student in her American high school who is older than she is but in the same grade. (She told me that she and the other student, who is actually a friendly person, had tacitly decided not to talk to one another at all because they couldn’t get over the awkward age-required formality issue.)</p>\n<p>But she knew she wanted out, and so Sun came to the U.S. for high school. She feels she can be more creative here. She can try new things. She might even start over some day.</p>\n<p>I know this is too simple. But the fact that our system (however flawed) allows for creativity matters. And we’re the place where the first generation of Internet inventiveness happened, sparked in the mid-1980s by the <a href='http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/cyber/internet.jsp' title='' rel=''>National Science Foundation’s determination</a> to lead the nation in networking technologies</p>\n<p><a href='http://nyti.ms/1SpDNsM' title='' rel=''>News this week</a> that NSF is doing it again, expanding its existing high-speed investments by way of a <a href='http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1541349&HistoricalAwards=false' title='' rel=''>five-year, $5 million grant</a> connecting research universities to multi-gigabit high-capacity fiber links, makes me optimistic. This investment will eventually trickle down, just as the country’s original NSFNet backbone investment did. The existence of much-higher-capacity networks at universities will, in time, lead to more Americans being used to routinely shipping around vast quantities of data</p>\n<p>And American entrepreneurs, raised in schools where learning is more important than memorization, will come up with great things to do with these networks.</p>\n<p>Plus, watch Jon Stewart. He’ll surprise us.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*QXPFTt0jOZKk4eEiVci9cA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>	2015-08-28 03:00:40.158592	2015-09-16 13:00:41.531643	<h2><strong>How South Korea Squanders Its Fiber Advantage By Run-Amok Rote Learning</strong></h2>\n<h4>The US must emulate SKR’s Internet speeds and costs — but not its education system</h4>

(US Army photo/SPC Eddie Siguenza)</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This is the life story of the ACU, and its obituary.</p>\n<p>By way of definitions, the “ACU” will actually stay, though with a different pattern. The current pattern is technically called, “Universal Camouflage Pattern”(UCP). It’s replacement, which some Soldiers have already begun to wear, is the “Operational Camouflage Patterned” (OCP).</p>\n<p>The OCP-ACU has become well known for its use in Afghanistan since around mid-2010, but those ACUs were only to be worn in that particular theater. So hen Soldiers refer to ACUs, they likely mean the UCP, or “digital camo.”</p>\n<p>The ACU was officially announced service-wide on the Army’s birthday, June 14, in 2004. Worn in garrison stateside until the present and in the Afghanistan until a few years ago, it is nevertheless the unmistakeble uniform of the Iraq War. Most of the 800,000 Soldiers who served in Iraqi Freedom or New Dawn wore it. Thousands bled in it. Too many died in it.</p>\n<p>But remembering those images of the invasion and early occupation phases, it was the tan desert Battle Dress Uniform that respresented the U.S. ground force.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*v4xuTCUHM9jZyNrH4VWAhg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Soldiers donned in Desert Combat Uniforms from Troop C, 2nd Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division (Stryker Brigade Combat Team) and Company F, 425th Infantry search a home in Tal Afar, Iraq.

Blair Larson)</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Senior military leaders recognized that Soldiers weren’t fighting in the desert, though, and they wanted a more multi-purpose uniform. By 2004, thousands of troops were serving in the cities and deserts of Mesopotamia, as well as the mountains of Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>“The goal was not to change the look of the Army,” said Lt. Col. Dave Anderson, who headed Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment at PEO Soldier, the Army agency charged with outfitting the force. “The goal was to find a more functional uniform.”</p>\n<p>Change the look of the Army, it did, however. By late 2006 all U.S. Army troops had ACUs, and the old BDUs were never to be seen in combat again. The ACU, and its “digitized” UCP, had become the distinctive symbol of the United States Army.</p>\n<h4><strong>Genealogy of the Army Combat Uniform</strong></h4>\n<p>Military planners had foreseen combat in urban centers before 9/11, but with Iraqi Freedom, a uniform that could perform in a variety of terrains took on an unmatched urgency. The Army settled on a camouflage pattern that had roots in research done at West Point in the 1970s; one that contrasted mightily with the patterns that represented U.S. Army uniforms during the entire 20th century.</p>\n<p>Some scholars have argued that, while military clothing has had some utilitarian value from a tactical standpoint, uniforms since the Industrial Revolution have largely been devised to communicate more than to work.</p>\n<p>That began to change in World War I, when aerial surveillance in alerted military leaders to the need for camouflage; at that time there were plenty of artists who were ready to supply the needed theories and designs. Clothing was colored to blend, but patterns did not emerge until much later.</p>\n<p>During the Second World War, the Allies began in earnest to produce uniforms that would be functional in any part of the world. The U.S. developed the recognizable woodland camouflage pattern that incorporated interlocking globule-shaped spots of green, brown, tan, and black.</p>\n<p>The green “fatigues,” adopted in 1954, were designed to “achieve a distinctive appearance for U.S. Army personnel and an identity as an attractively uniformed Armed Service.” American involvement in Indochina was accompanied by slight iterations in the fatigues, and the Army even used the woodland camouflage, appropriate for jungle operations, that had first been developed in 1948.</p>\n<p>The conclusion of American intervention in Southeast Asia ushered in a new era for the Army. The move to an All-Volunteer Force (AVF) and subsequent repositioning to a tenuous peace during the Cold War brought opportunities for the Army to rebrand itself. The adoption of the woodland camouflage pattern in 1981 became symbolic of the Army’s post-Vietnam posture as “ready armored defender of central Europe.”</p>\n<p>During Operation Desert Storm, action in Somalia in 1993, the NATO operations in the Balkans, and the early years of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the woodland camouflage BDU (and its sister the Desert Combat Uniform) represented the Army and its actions, speaking sartorially for it to a domestic public.</p>\n<p>The advent of the War on Terror sent American Soldiers in large numbers to Afghanistan, and then to Iraq.</p>\n<p>New tactical environments were far from the only shifts occurring in the military. In 2004, the same year the Army began field testing the new uniform in combat, Chief of Staff Gen. Erik Shinseki made clear that it was “in the midst of a profound transformation.” That transformation manifest itself in garments it issued to its Soldiers that very year.</p>\n<h4><strong>Dual Textured Camo</strong></h4>\n<p>In 1977 an instructor at West Point had begun testing his own camouflage designs. The founder of the U.S. Military Academy’s engineering-psychology program, then-Maj. Timothy O’Neill, painted an armored personnel carrier with two-inch squares to test his ideas of color blending and concealment.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*vE8NILrGzHmuYqzVEAjgNQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>His team called the result “dual-tex,” for dual texture. It was based upon the U.S. Cold War strategy of Active Defense, which required “combined arms team to allow for a combination of firepower and movement where firepower was used to allow the defender to move into a position from which more firepower could be used to destroy the attacker’s forces.” Thus, victory depended more than ever on the ability to hide and move.</p>\n<p>O’Neill thought that “intra-pattern value differentiation” was the key to hiding large equipment on the move. Basically, he created a smaller pattern within the larger shapes in the macro-pattern. “I needed to have a texture that matched natural backgrounds for a variety of reasons, so we dragged a dead M113 armored personnel carrier out into the middle of a field… and painted it by hand,” using a two-inch roller.</p>\n<p>The result was a pattern radically different from the monochrome fatigues or the woodland camouflage used at the time. Small, randomized squares created a “micropattern” that blended in with the background at close range. The micropattern within the macropattern resulted in a dual-textured design.</p>\n<p>Some equipment in the European Command was patterned with dual-tex, but it largely disappeared from the military for twenty years, until it was revived at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center in Massachusetts. Natick, responsible for outfitting soldiers with the best combat equipment, took up the task of designing the new uniform based on O’Niell’s work.</p>\n<p>“The pattern is not a 100-percent solution in every environment, but a good solution across the board,” said Sgt. First Class Jeff Myhre, a noncommissioned officer affiliated with Natick at the tme of the ACU development.</p>\n<h4><strong>Digital Warriors</strong></h4>\n<p>The most striking feature of the new Army uniform, and the visual element that created the most meaning, was the pixilated appearance of the universal camouflage pattern. In (at the time) classified reports, researchers mentioned that dual-tex patterns looked so different from fatigues or woodland patterns that developers described the computer-generated pattern as “impressionist.”</p>\n<p>Striclty speaking, digital camouflage is any pattern created by a computer, which dual-tex was. But in the computer age, the UCP adopted by Natick became synonymous with the trappings of network-centric warfare and a digital force (real or imagined).</p>\n<p>The Army encouraged this view. Shinseki’s successor, Gen. Peter Schoomaker, described in the Army’s 2004 Posture Statement a “strategically responsive, networked, precision capabilities-based maneuver force that is dominant across the range of military operations envisioned for the future.”</p>\n<p>One important aspect of the digitization theme is dominance, reinforced by the Army’s public messages. In its 2005 Posture Statement, whose publically-released print version incorporated the digital design, Army leadership presented the Future Force. Like the 2004 statement, the need for forward thinking was aimed at battlefield dominance. Increasingly, the Army would associate itself with power and technology. By the next year, it would abandon the Army of One slogan in favor of “Army Strong.” The ACU and digital camouflage were its emblem.</p>\n<h4><strong>A Warrior’s Uniform</strong></h4>\n<p>While the Army Combat Uniform was visually radical, it also represented more traditional aspects of war craft that the Army carefully cultivated. The highest ranking enlisted soldier in the Army at the time of the ACU’s introduction, Sgt. Maj. of the Army Kenneth Preston said, “The ACU is a warrior’s uniform; it’s a uniform designed by Soldiers.”</p>\n<p>The emphasis on “warrior,” another word beginning to come into fashion within the military, represented the reality that Soldiers would <em>fight </em>wearing the ACU. This is the source of the ACU’s most powerful rhetoric, as men and women who wore them were fighting and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the American public was reminded of that fact every day for almost a decade</p>\n<p>The Warrior Ethos program, began by Shinseki in 2003, stressed an Army that embodied values adopted as part of training and doctrine in the late 1990s. The Soldier’s Creed was a more recent phenomenon, having been created and adopted during the War on Terror. All soldiers memorized and recited the Soldier’s Creed:</p>\n<>I am an American Soldier. I am a warrior and a member of a team. I serve the People of the United States, and live the Army Values. <strong>I will always place the mission first. I will never accept defeat. I will never quit.</strong> I will never leave a fallen comrade. I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and proficient in my warrior tasks and drills. I always maintain my arms, my equipment and myself. I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy, the enemies of the United States of American in close combat. I am a Guardian of Freedom and the American Way of Life. I am an American Soldier</>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*YAk_KelER08IFC8TpJQYgQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Drill Sgt. Angela Lee, of the 98th Training Division, instructs recruits undergoing Basic Combat Training on reacting to a chemical attack during a round-robin training session held March 14 at Fort Jackson, S.C.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>During periods of reformation for any institution, there is the need to balance the new with a sense of stability and tradition. So even while Shinseki was lobbying for change, he reaffirmed the Army’s “nonnegotiable contract with the American public” and insisted that transformation was necessary in order for the Army to continue “defending the Constitution.”</p>\n<p>The new pattern inherited much of the rhetorical power of its progenitors, while constructing new messages that earlier versions couldn’t have communicated. It was also advertised as highly functional. In fact, leaders often cited its tactical utility as the main reason for its adoption. The message was that the ACU was useful, and would help the United States win in ground combat. It represented the Army’s attention to what soldiers in the field needed and wanted to “fight and win the Nation’s wars.”</p>\n<h4><strong>Forward Deployed and </strong>Working Har</h4>\n<p>Of course, many Soldiers reported complaints. Here, utility and image intersected even in criticism of the uniform. The ACU famously banished polish and starch, totally irrelevant artifacts of an earlier era. Yet Soldiers pointed out that the new ACU stained too easily. Another early complaint was that it wasn’t durable.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the ACUs that American’s saw on television were often dirty, as images came back from Iraq and Afghanistan. But they reinforced the values that the Army clearly wanted to associate with their uniformed soldiers — one of which, aside from teamwork, was hard work and service to the public despite austere conditions. A Soldier could be forgiven dust on her boots or a spot on her trousers if he was an ocean away serving her country.</p>\n<p>Over time, modifications were made to make the pants more sturdy, and buttons replaced velcro on pants pockets. But by and large, the ACU remained as it was in 2004.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*vbGfhFffU-16E5MmZL1IHA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">A Paratrooper from Bravo Troop, 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment (Airborne), pulls security during a patrol near Forward Operating Base Keating in Nuristan Province, Afghanistan March 1, 2008.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The biggest criticism by far, though, was that the ACU didn’t perorm its main function: to conceal. Despite the evidence supplied by O’Neill and his West Point researchers, many Soldier’s remained unconvinced that ACUs could provide camouflage in either of the two main combat areas, Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Army leaders seemed to have got the message, at least as far as Afghanistan was concerned. Units deploying to Afghanistan were issued the OCP — called “multi-cam” at the time —begining in 2010. Preston said the new uniforms would allow “Soldiers to get far closer to the enemy before being observed.”</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, OCP harkened to an earlier era, going “retro” at a time when the Army’s claim to technological superiority began to lose its luster. The Afghan insurgency seemed to be gaining a second wind, and counterinsurgency doctrine itself was under fire. High-tech weaponry like drones were raising the enemy body count to seemingly little avail, and for all the communication and surveillance advances the U.S. military had made, the Taliban was giving American Soldiers a run for their money, according to the Army’s harshest critics.</p>\n<p>In Iraq, the drawdown of troops meant the ACU’s combat finale, while Afghanistan bound Soldiers wore the updated pattern.</p>\n<h4><strong>UCP Goes Pop</strong></h4>\n<p>Military style has historically permeated civilian fashion, both in mimicry of the martial and in rebellion against it. The Army uniform of the past decade represented more conformist motivations, legitimizing the rhetoric that the Army instilled in it. It accentuated traditional military values, while at the same time infusing it with the values of youth. Its success in doing so is reflected in the way the digital camouflage has found its way into popular culture.</p>\n<p>The camouflaged patterns used by the U.S. military since the advent of the War on Terror represented a more modern way of thinking about the military for the broader culture. The Army used the rhetoric of the computer age to brand itself, and the visual rhetoric of the UCP was the perfect complement. (the Marine Corps used a digitized camouflage since 2002, while the Air Force and Navy adopted ditigal camo after the Army).</p>\n<p>Components of the rhetorical package included ethics of the digital society such as youth, energy, and creativity on one hand, and ironically, individualism, resistance and anonymity on the other.</p>\n<p>As Gen. Shinseki had gazed toward the future in the early 2000s, he no doubt saw a youthful force. New and potential soldiers embody the energy and creativity that a future, powerful, and high-tech army would require.</p>\n<p>But if anything spoke to the reinterpretation of the rhetorical uniform since 2001, it was the phenomenon of its incorporation into athletic uniforms.</p>\n<p>The University of Utah, in 2010, was one of the first major schools whose football team donned uniforms infused with the digital camouflage patterns. Explained Salt Lake City’s <em>Deseret News</em>, “The jerseys…have core values like “honor,” “integrity,” “country,” “service,” and “duty” lie on back instead of last names.</p>\n<p>To the athletic clothing manufacturer Under Armour, local soldiers, and university athletic officials, then, the rhetoric of the ACU was entirely positive, and the team, local soldiers, and the university were all proud to be able to wear them in support of a charity that helped wounded vets. The paper’s readership received them positively, judging by the comments on the <em>Deseret News</em> website. All reader comments that mentionined the uniforms framed them positively. One reader wrote, ‘There really are things bigger than sports, and this proves it.</p>\n<p>Several university football teams that year debuted uniforms influenced by the UCP, including Maryland, Georgia Tech, and Texas A&M. The service academies had begun the trend in 2009, when Army and Navy “[broke] ranks from the traditional, unadorned look for a set of new ‘Enforcer’ unis.” The user comments here, too, were overwhelmingly in favor of the style, impressed by the rhetorical power of the digital camouflage pattern in the helmets and the pants.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*sZDNtmbe8K4hV9nnU2gCFw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>In the case of athletic uniforms, corporations seem to recognize and appropriate the rhetorical power of digital camouflage. Such manifestations were probably the best indicator of how well the military’s message had permeated the culture.</p>\n<p>Even the best marketing campaigns have a shelf life, and UCP’s was about ten years.</p>\n<p>The new OCP has already begun appearing around garrisons, though the old UCP is authorized until 2019. Undoubtedly, Soldiers will rush to get the new uniforms, partly due to the novelty, but mostly due to the disdain for the UCP.</p>\n<p>It is somewhat surprising that Army personnel have such antipathy for the uniform that continues to symbolize their service to much of the public. Contrasted against the BDU, the digital camo was more distincively associated with the Army. The ACU’s predecessor was a generic looking camouflage that could have — and was — produced by a number of countries’ armies.</p>\n<p>The ACU <em>was a part of the Army brand itself</em></p>\n<p>Most Soldiers currently in the Army never wore the BDU, yet many still prefer it to the UCP-ACU. A surprsing number of Soldiers also have very pronounced greivances with the UCP-ACU: the Velcro makes too much noise, it looks sloppy, and most of all, it doesn’t conceal well in most terrain.</p>\n<p>The sloppiness critique might be an indication of generational differences, but on utilitarian grounds doesn’t make much sense. Black leather boots may have looked better, but time spent polishing them was time <em>not </em>spent studying up on tactics or cleaning a weapon. Moreover, what looks good and what doesn’t is totally arbitrary</p>\n<p>The concealment critique is easier to understand, though still not very rational. In the scheme of winning a war, the ability of any given Soldier to hide in a particular well terrain has relatively little to do with it. Of all the variables a commander would consider in his or her assessment of an engagement with the enemy, ability to conceal would rank very low. And to the extent that it does, it depends entirely on the characteristics of the particular terrain. The OCP might work very well in mountainous desert, but poorly in urban areas.</p>\n<p>More likely, Army personnel have been uneasy with its emerging identity as the Future Force of Shinseki’s dreams. When their battle buddies went home in caskets from Iraq and Afghanistan in increasing numbers, maybe they thought, <em>who needs this digital warfare stuff anyway? </em>It wouldn’t be the first time the military took criticism for its attempts to move into the future before it could fend off the present. In the 1980s, Army reformists Gary Hart and Williams Lind wrote about high-tech equipment that</p>\n<>The best thing a combat unit could do with most of it is to kick it off the back of the truck when they move out to fight.</>\n<p>All said, it is this Soldier’s opinion that the Army, its personnel, and the American public were well served by the digital camo ACU. It presented the Army as a trustworthy institution during a period of intense dissatisfaction with many other social and political intitutions. Even as support for the Iraq War declined after 2006, support for the Army remained relatively steady and high. Maybe the ACU was just another thing to cast off in the long reassessment of the Iraq War.</p>\n<p>But Preston had it right. It is a warrior’s uniform. And it will be missed.</p>	2015-07-14 19:46:14.901961	2015-07-14 19:46:14.901961	<p>Last month, an alert went out to all U.S. Army Soldiers giving them notice that their uniforms — their Army Combat Uniforms — have an expiration date.</p>\n<p>The ACU is what you’ve all come to know and love from Army Strong commericals and ubiquitous Facebook ads for masters degrees in counterterrorism.</p>

In light of recent events surrounding what the Confederate flag respresents, I repost for your consideration.</em></p>\n<p>Should a U.S. Soldier be allowed to fly a Mexican flag from his porch on a forward military base?</p>\n<p>Now, many of you will, no doubt, have reflexive responses to this question. I <em>really</em> want to read your comments, and I am <em>very</em> curious about their variety</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*sU1GZbrJl-NSkkLbl6xLFQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Actual Mexican flag flown from barracks at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Before you type out your answer, consider these additional thought-provoking questions:</p>\n<li>What if the flag was Canadian or British?</li>\n<li>Should the command craft a policy letter prohibiting offending flags?</li>\n<li>How would you deem which flags are prohibited, given the fact that the forward base is home to seven NATO nations?</li>\n<li>Would state flags be subject to the same regulations?</li>\n<li>What about athletic team flags?</li>\n<p>The original responses can be read <a href='http://my-public-affairs.blogspot.com/2009/08/return-to-cynicism.html' title='' rel=''>at my old blogger site</a></p>\n<p>I followed up the query post with my own thoughts:</p>\n<p>This was a can of worms. I will attempt to pack the slimy things back in and seal it up nicely without getting any slime on me. Many good points were made.</p>\n<p>First, my assessment of the situation.</p>\n<p>There is undeniably a lot of antipathy in the United States towards Mexican immigrants. No need to open a <em>new </em>can of worms with a lengthy explanation on that claim. But Canadians aren’t immigrating by the hundreds of thousands, and even if they were, it wouldn’t be very apparent, given their language, customs, and complexion</p>\n<p>Having said that, I personally love the contributions of Mexican culture to our own. I just enjoyed a scrumptious meal of: one beef enchilada, one taco, and some strange potato dish that claimed to be part of the Mexican fare. That meal — a refreshing change at the Camp Bondsteel D-Fac — would have been unlikely but for the Mexican influence in the United States.</p>\n<p>Alright, first is the point oft-made that Army Soldiers should pay homage to one flag. Agreed. But flying another doesn’t have to take away from the fidelity rendered to Old Glory, does it? The real issue behind some of the comments is that of <em>sameness</em></p>\n<p>Army leaders —leaders of any organization, for that matter, but especially Army types —can’t stand individuality. They want to look over their dominions and say, “what a nice, tidy, uniform bunch of people I have.”</p>\n<p>Anytime a leader makes a general rule to address a specific situation, he is often overreaching and overreacting.</p>\n<p>Better the attitude, I think, to (pardon the bumper sticker phrase) “celebrate diversity.” A leader should be saying, “Look here, I have 1500 troops that represent dozens of cultures, religions, language preferences, and sports teams, and we are all in unity as to the mission.</p>\n<p>“Unity of Effort,” is, in fact, one of KFOR’s mottoes. Not “Unity of Thought” or “Unity of Appearance.”</p>\n<p>Some in the Army can’t get past their fetish for conformity in appearance. The uniform is one thing, but there are many who can’t stand anything that deviates from their preferences or point of view.</p>\n<p>So the Soldier who wants the Mexican flag taken down may be the most patriotic person in the force, and he may have friends who have died in combat, and he may send his grandmother flowers every week. But on the homefront he’s the same guy who wants me trim back my bushes because they’re unsightly, or wants me to wash my car more often because it makes the neighborhood look trashy, or wants me to wear a tie to church because he doesn’t want others to get the impression that we all, God forbid, think differently.</p>\n<p>Flying a flag of your choice doesn’t impede the mission.</p>\n<p>Let’s not confuse tacky with right. It may be tacky to fly a Mexican flag. Hell, I lived in downtown Oakland (during my Kosovo tour), not exactly the most military-friendly locale in the state. and fly an Army flag from my front porch. Most of my neighbors, and the radicals who pass by my busy street daily, think that’s tacky. Let ‘em.</p>\n<p>I think Army leaders would be more comfortable if Mexican flags weren’t flown, and they wouldn’t have to worry about it. It’s reminiscent of a dialogue from the should-be classic <em>The Breakup</em></p>\n<p>“Do you want me to do the dishes?”</p>\n<p>“I want you to <em>want </em>to do the dishes.</p>\n<p>Instead of trying to enforce a cult-like fanaticism of their preference for “Unity of Appearance,” they should spend a little time instilling the values that lead one to want to fly the American Flag. Then they can worry about regulating its size, fabric, etc.</p>\n<p>So here’s a recap:</p>\n<li>Should a U.S. Soldier be allowed to fly a Mexican flag from his porch on a forward military base? YES</li>\n<li>What if the flag was Canadian or British? YES and YES</li>\n<li>Should the command craft a policy letter prohibiting offending flags? NO</li>\n<li>How would you deem which flags are prohibited, given the fact that the forward base is home to seven NATO nations? WHATEVER IS IN EXISTING MILITARY CODE: HATE GROUPS ETC., WOULD BE BANNED</li>\n<li>Would state flags be subject to the same regulations? What about athletic team flags? EVERYTHING GOES, EXCEPT FOR LAKERS AND YANKEES</li>\n<p>A final question to tie this all back to the current controversy. Should American Soldiers be allowed fly a Confederate flag?</p>\n<p>A flag can mean a lot of things. The Confederate flag certainly does. But given that it was raised in opposition to the very existence of our Consitution and Union, which all Soldiers swear to uphold and defend, this Soldier says, “no.”</p>	2015-07-14 19:46:15.612722	2015-07-14 19:46:15.612722	<p><em>Six years ago I had the pleasure of serving in the Kosovo Force, during which time I was stationed at Camp Bondsteel.

(U.S. Army photo by Justin Silvers)</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The following is an excerpt from <em>Nine Weeks: A Teacher’s Education in Army Basic Training.</em></p>\n<p>The cornerstone of the PT program was Conditioning Drill 1 (CD1) — a set of exercises designed to target every muscle group in the body. But soldiers can only do CD1 when they are properly arrayed. Not particularly rigorous, CD1 is another opportunity to practice discipline and uniform responses to simple commands.By discipline I am referring to such time-honored practices as not flinching when a mosquito lands anywhere on your body.</p>\n<p>“Let ‘em get some of that!” DS Robertson would holler. Doubly a reminder to apply sufficient insect repellant, and a discipline drill, mosquitoes seemed to serve the beckon call of our drill sergeants.</p>\n<p>“The Bend and Reach!”</p>\n<p>“<em>The Bend and Reach!</em>” We echoed the command to prove adequate motivation</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*10f3-E-3POsHTAh03YfEpw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>“Starting position, MOVE!”</p>\n<p>Nearly every command in the Army has two parts: the preparatory command and the command of execution. Uponhearing “Starting position” a soldier knows what he will do, and that a verb is soon to follow — “MOVE!” The execution command is the cue for everyone to go to the starting position in this case. It’s almost elegant in its design.</p>\n<p>Ask twenty privates fresh from Basic to recite or lead CD1, and nineteen would go dumb trying to remember the phraseology, order, and voice-inflection rules of commands. Yet all twenty could follow the routine to exactitude. We were a pack of Pavlov’s dogs; our reward was simply to not get yelled at.</p>\n<p>“The Rear Lunge!”</p>\n<p><em>“The Rear Lunge!”</em></p>\n<p>“Starting position, move!”… “One — two — three.”</p>\n<p>“<em>ONE!</em>” We bellowed back. The CD1 repetitions were all done in four counts, the last of which was called out by the soldiers in tow. The instructor would inflect his voice on the three counts prior to the last repetition, which put us back in the starting position. Naturally, we remained in said position until given a new command: “Position of attention, MOVE!” With a jarring urgency, the formation would snap back to attention</p>\n<p>“The Highjumper!”</p>\n<p>“<em>The Highjumper!</em>” We rolled through the exercises obediently.DS Robertson was the essence of duty as he led us through the drill. “You won’t do these retarded exercises in a regular unit,” he offered candidly. Anything that DS Robertson disliked was “retarded,” be it a drill, regulation, or person. Retarded as they were, we followed the exercises to a “T.” That phrase had military meaning, as well, according to Robertson. “T” stood for “trained.</p>\n<p>A soldier did something “to a T,” only if he was properly trained. If it was not “to a T,” then he needed retraining, which usually meant “correction through physical exercise.” But that was in the bay, and in the mornings we were outside on the PT field, doing the bare minimum.</p>\n<p>Besides, it was always the drill instructors leading PT, andthey never made a mistake. Not anything major that couldn’t be corrected by a simple, “as you were,” the great eraser. It is the polite military way of saying, “my mistake,” or “sorry about that, I screwed up.” A perfect example was when DS Jackson would call us to the position of attention before putting us in the starting position, which is an egregious breech of protocol. It would happen like this:</p>\n<p>“One, two three”</p>\n<p>“<em>Halt!</em></p>\n<p>“Position of attention, MOVE!”We delayed a response. At that point our minds attempted to tell our muscles to obey the command and put our bodies at the position of attention, but our muscles only knew of one thing to do after our mouths shouted out “halt,” namely, to go to the “starting position.” These were the types of ethical dilemmas in which we would find ourselves at Basic. Luckily, DS Jackson would come to his senses before half of the platoon decided that the position of attention was less uncomfortable than the starting position and say those magic words, “as you were,” which would put us into a forgivable limbo until the command loop would reset and we would get an order that everyone’s brains and muscles could agree on.</p>\n<p>“As you were” was a phrase that only NCOs could use, not because it violated any rule for a private to pronounce it, but because its use was a subtle art form, and before anyone below a sergeant’s rank ever mastered the art, NCOs would unleash a tirade upon him for being so maladroit as to get himself into a situation that necessitated the phrase. So we followed along dumbly as the drill sergeants imposed order, in nearly perfect fashion, each morning. Most of the time, they got it “to a T.”</p>\n<p>The arrangement of the exercises was one thing that was flawless. After the first three exercises followed: 4) The Rower, 5) The Squat Bender, 6) The Windmill, 7) The Forward Lunge, 8) TheProne Row, 9) The Bent-leg Body Twist, and 10) The Push-up.</p>\n<p>I never heard a drill sergeant lead them out of order. How? “Be Right Here Real Soon, We Found Panties Behind Popeye’s.” Angry drill sergeants devised the cleverest mnemonics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Note: in Basic Training, eight years ago, I’m quite certain our drills called the above-described routine “Conditioning Drill 1.” Now, as part of the Army’s Physical Readiness Program it is called the “Preparation Drill.” CD1 refers to a different set of exercises.</em></p>	2015-07-14 19:46:17.018284	2015-07-14 19:46:17.018284	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*R7k8AQzevKxXuiGa0xecgw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The following is an excerpt from <em>Nine Weeks: A Teacher’s Education in Army Basic Training.</em></p>

Homejoy was far from alone in its troubles, with lawsuits, bad press, and political pressure circling the contractor-dependent companies in the industry. In recent weeks, Instacart, Sprig, Luxe Valet, and Shyp changed at least some of their independent contractors into old-fashioned employees. (Many of those claim the shift was in the name of good business practices.) Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft continued battling class action lawsuits about their drivers, contractors who receive no wages or benefits. Perhaps not since Foxconn has there been more chatter of the frontline workers that power Silicon Valley</p>\n<p>The labor debate has even hit the presidential campaign trail, with Hillary Clinton saying the gig economy raises “hard questions” about good jobs. Republican candidates <a href='http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/republicans-hail-uber-in-bid-for-tech-cred-120052.html' title='' rel=''>blasted back</a> that she wants to stifle innovation, and Clinton decided to <a href='http://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/hillary-clinton-silicon-valley.html' title='' rel=''>hobnob with industry titans</a> to hear them out on the issue</p>\n<p>Amid the controversy, one of the nation’s top labor authorities loosed a bombshell: a <a href='http://www.dol.gov/whd/workers/Misclassification/AI-2015_1.pdf' title='' rel=''>new paper</a> declaring that a vast amount of U.S. toilers are misclassified as contractors, when “most workers are employees.” Business interests went batty. Pundits rushed to question how the guidance might apply to the on-demand economy</p>\n<p>To sort through the morass, Backchannel sat down for an old-school D.C. conference call with the bureaucrats themselves, top U.S. Department of Labor guys, whose jobs have arguably just gotten sexier and much more relevant to Silicon Valley as of late. First up was Obama-appointed <a href='https://medium.com/@LaborSec' title='' rel=''>U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez</a>. He was followed by the administrator of the department’s wage and hour division who issued the new guidance on contractors, Dr. David Weil. We talked contractors, Uber, and the gathering storm of industry folks calling for a third category of worker</p>\n<p>Perhaps most surprisingly, it turns out that Perez actually peruses the past articles you send before the interview — even the one entitled “<a href='https://medium.com/the-wtf-economy/what-strippers-can-teach-uber-1f5b15e5b427' title='' rel=''>What Strippers Can Teach Uber</a>,” which clearly piqued his interest. The interview is edited for length and clarity</p>\n<p><strong>[Secretary Perez]: </strong>I can honestly say I have never read a piece in my job here, or frankly, in any job, that educated me about strippers. So I wanted to thank you at the outset for that</p>\n<p><strong>[Backchannel]: Yeah, well, it turned out the dancers’ business arrangement with the strip clubs had a lot in common with Uber. [Both claim in lawsuits that they provide the platform on which the worker can ply her trade.]</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not touching that one, okay? [He chuckles.]</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think that these hundreds of millions of U.S. gigs created by on-demand apps are a good source of post-recession jobs, or do you see them as problematic?</strong></p>\n<p>What I’ve observed many times [is that people] make false choices. I see some Republican presidential candidates saying with this new economy, as long as we innovate and don’t regulate, everybody does great. That’s a false choice and an incorrect understanding of what the new economy is or can be about<strong>. </strong>We have to resist the the temptation to conclude this is an either/or economy. We have to resist the temptation to say the only way you can innovate is if you have no protections for workers, or you tell a person with a disability who uses a guide dog that protections they thought they had under the ADA (American Disabilities Act)<strong> </strong>[don’t apply]. There’s no room for that in the modern economy. I don’t think that’s what innovation is about and I don’t think innovation so dictates</p>\n<p><strong>Silicon Valley holds that it’s disrupting work. Marc Andreessen talks about a utopian ideal of work at the press of a button. Do you actually see the on-demand economy as providing a new type of work?</strong></p>\n<p>When I hear about “the gig economy,” implicit in that for some is a sense that this is the first time people work from gig to gig. That’s just not right. You look at homecare workers and domestic workers and so many other low wage workers who have been surviving, oftentimes barely….people have been working from gig to gig for quite some time. We need to make sure people working gig to gig can make a living. In the new economy and beyond, we see many examples of employers realizing their workers are their most precious resource, that you have to think longterm if you want to be successful. When you think longterm, you invest in workers and meaningfully engage your workers.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there <em>anything</em> about the on-demand economy that you see as a new labor development, or is all the disruption talk a ruse?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t know if I’d call it new. But certainly technology has always been at the forefront of change, whether it was the cotton gin or the Internet or the app economy. There will be a technology 20 years from now, two years from now, that creates new nouns and verbs you and I can’t imagine.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you use any of these services — Uber, Instacart?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m the wrong guy to ask on Uber because I have a security detail. [He laughs.]</p>\n<p><strong>Instacart for groceries, the laundry services?</strong></p>\n<p>I have not personally tried any of them. It’s interesting you mention Instacart, because it’s my understanding the owner of Instacart has made a judgment that the people doing the shopping should have the option of being called employees.</p>\n<p><strong>Yep, Instacart and others in the on-demand industry have changed from contractors to employees in the past couple months. Do you applaud that shift?</strong></p>\n<p>What I applaud in the Instacart context is the recognition that workers aren’t fungible. This is skilled labor. If you want [to] build a sustainable business model, you want to have folks that actually know what they’re doing. When you invest in your workers, you’re going to get a return on investment. The conclusion that the only way you can build an on-demand economy is by having no rules and no protection, that’s just wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>That brings up the guidance the department issued last month on what the Fair Labor Standards Act has to say about the employee versus contractor question. Considering its declaration that “most workers are employees,” does the department think on-demand workers are employees?</strong></p>\n<p>No. That would be an incorrect assumption. The guidance is not a dissemination of new policy. It’s a statement of existing policy and a response to feedback we’d gotten from both employers and workers alike that we’d like to have a clear statement of what the rules of engagement are in this context. That’s what that was. Every case is fact specific. The most frequently asked question I’m getting now is, “Are the Uber folks workers or independent contractors?: The answer is: if we get a complaint, we would conduct a very fact-specific determination that would be no different of when you ask me if construction workers are workers or independent contractors. The analysis would be identical.</p>\n<p><em>[At this point, as previously arranged, the Secretary bowed out of the conversation. He turned the conversation over to Adminstrator David Weil, the author of the aforementioned report.]</em></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mnRrj5e0yZqPsfw8IBvE6A.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rFQrBAkNTxSXjGT4ag8sPA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Weil, what do you make of the argument that the old labor buckets of contractor or employee don’t encompass workers signing into an app at will? Are you in favor of legislators creating a third category of worker?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[David Weil]:</strong> I’m the administrator of my agency, and so I think about work within the structure of the existing laws and what they allow us to do. That’s a not a dodge [of the question], but I do have to think about the ability and mission given the statutes as they exist. This is something we talked about in the guidance. Of any federal statute, the Fair Labor Standards Act has one of the broadest definitions— in fact the Supreme Court decisions says [it is] the broadest definition — of what it means to employ.<strong> </strong>It gives us a way to think about the old economy, the newer old economy, and the digital economy</p>\n<p>We don’t want to be either overly dazzled by the platform [workers] may have come from, or overly skeptical of it. I think we want to get to the basics of the relationship. [The point] really is about trying to protect people who might not have a lot of options in that [employee] relationship, and making sure they do. Sometimes in the discussion of the new economy, there’s the assumption that everyone on these platforms has equal leverage and options. I don’t think that’s any more true in a digital platform than in a more traditional labor market.</p>\n<p><strong>You mean options to get other work?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s right — to get other employment or to ask that their employment provides them certain outcomes or benefits. There are millions of people that don’t have that kind of outside option, regardless of the employment platform. We have the responsibility as a society to provide them with the protections provided in our basic labor standards.</p>\n<p><strong>In that vein, <a href='https://medium.com/ondemand/the-on-demand-diaries-i-was-a-taskrabbit-butler-2f8f9c5d319a' title='' rel=''>on Medium</a>, we had a story from a college grad, an ex-Googler who took a glorified butler job off TaskRabbit, then realized he was probably taking that job from someone who actually needed it. Does the potential of that happening worry you — that working class jobs are being encroached upon by folks with other options trying to earn low-commitment, extra bucks?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s parts of this gig economy that are emerging that we just need to understand more about — that applies equally to those of us in the labor department. Who has these jobs now may not be the same as who has these jobs 10 years from now. We have to be careful about the anecdotes. It might be true that the college grad wants a lot of flexibility and wants to be able to travel and pick up a little money on one of the digital platforms for driving folks around. But I don’t think you make laws or enforce laws on the basis of anecdotes. You base it on what we’re seeing emerge over time.</p>\n<p>I want to make sure — on any platform, digital or brick and mortar — people are making those decisions freely or with lots of options, or with no other option. Do they do it because I need to feed my family? Or do they afford me to get extra money and I’m doing quite fine anyways?<strong> </strong>We have to go always back to first principles of who are we trying to protect and how the people emerging in these new jobs fall on that spectrum</p>\n<p><strong>Do you welcome the class action lawsuits — like the ones against numerous on-demand companies — as an important part of enforcing labor law</strong></p>\n<p>The statute provides for both private rights of action and for us to do investigation. While we have no control over any of that [the lawsuits], it’s certainly part of a larger environment that pushes towards compliance with our basic labor standards. One thing I’m delighted about in the guidance is the incredible amount of public interest its engendered. It goes beyond the gig economy. Most misclassification we find is in the old economy — in what we sometimes call the <a href='http://www.fissuredworkplace.net/' title='' rel=''>fissured workplace.</a> [Editor’s note: Weil is being modest — he is credited for the term.] It’s about 29 million workers that are potentially subjected to misclassification in just our core economy</p>\n<p><strong>And with 1,000 investigators in the wage and hour division, it’s probably difficult to monitor every last industry.</strong></p>\n<p>We have 7.3 million workplaces falling under our statutes and about 135 million workers in them. So, on one hand, the president has helped our ability to obtain our mission tremendously: we have roughly 300 more investigations than we did at the beginning of the administration. [But] we have to be incredibly focused on where we put those resources. So we prioritize industries: we’re a data driven agency, we look at both the prevalence of the problem and where workers don’t step forward to exercise their own rights. We also want to have efficacy, so we think not only how the recovered wages affects those workers, but the behavior of other employers. That means we always have to think pretty hard about if it moves the needle on compliance generally.</p>\n<p><strong>There’s a cottage industry springing up in Silicon Valley around providing benefits to on-demand contractors, benefits that used to be provided by employers. What do you think about decoupling benefits from jobs?</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of those innovative ideas are great. A lot are about extending benefits beyond what the law requires, or giving greater portability opportunities to them. My agency is all about making sure bedrock standards are achieved and complied with, but that doesn’t mean we can’t go beyond that. Workers are having more and more jobs in the course of their career than ever before. We have to make sure fundamental standards are protected.</p>\n<p><strong>So I have to ask: do you Uber?</strong></p>\n<p>I do not Uber. I am a taxi user, by and large. Even more so, I’m a commuter, I live in Washington during the week but my family’s up in Boston. So I use the metro. I love the subway.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QXPFTt0jOZKk4eEiVci9cA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><em>Photograph via Getty Images</em></p>\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>\n<><a href='https://medium.com/p/ff06afad3713' title='https://medium.com/p/ff06afad3713' rel=''><strong>Should The Gov Create a “Third Worker” Category?</strong>\n<em>In an interview with the Secretary of Labor and his chief employment administrator, we found interest but not much…</em>medium.com</a></>	2015-08-28 03:00:41.34546	2015-09-09 19:00:40.146557	<h2>Why the US Secretary of Labor Doesn’t Uber</h2>\n<h4>America confronts the On-Demand Economy, and the DOL is on it.

Thousands of those…	2015-05-12 07:33:41	ea4d9173731e	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1200/1*2iCTLkEMD3GgwCebc7Yijg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Sgt.

Austin Valentine, a native of Chillicothe, Ohio, both serving as snipers for 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, pull security and discuss movement at their observation post overlooking the Darwazgay Pass in Zabul Province, Afghanistan, June 24. The Soldiers were part of a joint air assault mission conducted with the 1st Kandak, 2nd Battalion, 205th Corps, Afghan National Army, to disrupt weapons from coming into the area.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Since Operation Enduring Freedom was launched in 2001, millions of American soldiers have deployed to Afghanistan. Thousands of those troops were armed, in addition to their rifles and pistols, with cameras. Those cameras collected thousands of images that did many things: they provided the American public a context in which to make sense of the war that affected so many of them personally. They increased morale by connecting deployed service members to family and friends on the homefront. They also made arguments about the war.</p>\n<p>Communication scholar Cori Dauber wrote a series of articles examining how images from war intersect with policy makers’ perceptions about the public’s attitude toward military action. Her data set included news images of combat casualties and prisoners of war from Somalia, Bosnia, and the First Gulf War. She argued, before 9–11, that military planners and elected officials interpreted those images differently than their constituencies, and that Americans generally were more willing to countenance military casualties than government leaders were willing to risk. Her work is an example of how imagery from combat can be used to interpret arguments about war.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*PfY7kPPVZTLCj3xEHid9rg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">ARANAS, Afghanistan — Soldiers of B Company, 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, sleep through an early mountaintop sunrise at the “Ranch House,” an outpost in the Nuristan province.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>So what arguments did visual imagery professionals in the Defense Department make about the War in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>I selected several images from a Defense Department imagery database for each year that the database existed during Operation Enduring Freedom. It was set up in 2004, and for the past 11 years has allowed military public affairs and combat camera professionals to upload released imagery for use by civilians.</p>\n<p>While I didn’t choose from among every image produced in Afghanistan (there are at least 170,000), I did find a good number of representative photos. The Defense Video and Imagery Distribution System (DVIDS) displays statistics for downloads and web views of each media asset; I simply chose the images with the most web views, which tended to correlate to the greatest number of downloads.</p>\n<p>The average download on my final image set was 89, and the average number of web views is nearly 500. To give an idea of how significant that threshold is, a photo the Navy Seal Team that participated in Operation Red Wing has (at the time of this writing) 430 web views and 141 downloads. Lieutenant Michael Murphy, the team leader, was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 2007, and in 2014 the film <em>Lone Survivor</em> dramatized the events of the operation in which all but one of Murphy’s team was killed. That the photo didn’t get more traffic on the DVIDS site is evidence less of its popularity and more of the fact that all imagery on the site is in the public domain, so that once the photo is downloaded, it is able to be shared and distributed among civilians without attribution, such as on blogs, news site, and particularly social media. It is very reasonable to assume that 500 web views on DVIDS corresponds to many times that number through other media channels</p>\n<p>These images have been widely circulated. And they say something important about American military invovement in Afghanistan. Importantly, they make the argument that the U.S.-led NATO operation in Afghanistan was beneficial, necessary, and ultimately successful.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*sgwr_rH3onkRs4YUxID5rQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Marines with Weapons Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, run to security positions after offloading from a CH-53E Super Sea Stallion helicopter during a mission in Helmand province, Afghanistan, April 28, 2014.

Five days prior to the helicopter-borne mission, the company confiscated two rocket-propelled grenades in the vicinity of the village.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>In her many analyses, Dauber used a “visual interpretive approach” to make sense of war imagery and its relation to public policy and public opinion. In her analysis of images of American military prisoners of war and combat casualties, she asserts that an explicitly rhetorical focus can shed a great deal of understanding to the meaning of photographs.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*g6aM4EIjfz2gCkD2fam6IA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Sgt. Phillip Chang, Alaska Army National Guard, stands on a ledge at the King’s tomb in Kabul looking out as the sun dawns over a new day in Afghanistan.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>These OEF images have rhetorical dimensions, as well. The military personnel who go out with maneuver units and acquire the images have one foot planted firmly in the realm of photojournalism, and the other in the very subjective realm of the warfighter family. This duality often gives them access to spectacular and intimate scenes that civilian photojournalists might never see, even while constraining their ability to describe them in their full depth.</p>\n<p>Their products make an argument about the military’s involvement in Afghanistan and the institutions’ performance, and can be grouped in four categories that parallel arguments in favor of continued moral and emotional support of the war. These categories are: personal sacrifice, power, success, and security.</p>\n<h4><strong>Ready to Deploy</strong></h4>\n<p>Many of the most popular, and compelling, photos are of service members working hard in austere conditions. Very few of the photos selected were taken indoors. They frequently incorporate dusty, barren, forbidden terrain. They also include portraits- close-ups of soldiers who embody the notion of duty. In fact, duty has become a watchword of the modern volunteer force, and since 2004 soldiers have trained and organized around a creed which says in part, “I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy the enemies of the United States in close combat.”</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*pi9Y1pvrQ04TIneiJakj9A.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Sgt. 1st Class Lance Amsden, platoon sergeant for 1st Platoon, Company C, 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division, watches as CH-47 helicopters circle above during a dust storm at Forward Operating Base Kushamond July 17 during preparation for an air assault mission.

Clare)</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Deploying to unforgiving places is inherent in these photographs. Sometimes the subjects are stoic, stone-faced, and ready to execute an order unquestioningly. Other times they are smiling, assuring the viewer that the mission is not too unbearable, and in some ways satisfying. They argue of a force in service, willing to do what other Americans aren’t.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*encq43fB9bMMQuY5AFDTgw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Soldiers from Kandahar Air Field Quick Reaction Force (QRF) brace themselves against snow whipped up by an incoming Chinook.

The QRF is from 2nd Battalion, 35 Infantry Regiment, part of the 25th Infantry Division, Scholfield Barracks, Hawaii.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>If this argument sounds a bit too idealistic, it might be because it is carefully crafted by military public affairs professionals. Never would they promote messages — visual or otherwise — of service members in distress. Even in those images that clearly convey the hard and dangerous life of the deployed soldier, it is couched in terms of duty and sacrifice — martial virtues that seem to have pervaded among the American public.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h4><strong>Combat Power</strong></h4>\n<p>Another frequent visual argument is that the American military is unmatched in its combat power. From sorties of Marine aircraft to heavy tanks and fighting ground vehicles, technologically superior weaponry has always been at the heart of American fighting doctrine and the imagination of the public. That some of the most celebrated and symbolic weapons systems of the United States played only a minor role in OEF doesn’t prevent them from appearing in some of the most popular photos. Tanks, fighting vehicles, fighter jets, and artillery projected power but weren’t decisive in very many engagements.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*EqP15tJBuO0EeLaI2BRiNQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">A mounted U.S. Marine patrol returns from patrolling nearby villages during Operation Backstop Dec. 10 in Helmand province, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

While the actual success of OEF was up for grabs for many years, the images that made it through official channels left little doubt about which side had the power to win, and that power seemed to have been consumed eagerly by the public.</p>\n<h4><strong>Success Is Assured</strong></h4>\n<p>Just as an image is open to many interpretations, though, so is success. Yet many of the most popular DVIDS imagery argued that the American military was on a course to victory. It is the most basic message of war propaganda, after all — we will win. Winning, as such, was more difficult to claim in Afghanistan than successfully meeting mission requirements. Understood since 2006 as a long-term counterinsurgency campaign, success was at the same time easier to declare and harder to explain. The U.S. wasn’t celebrating enemy body counts, or territory under control, necessarily, but civil, social, and political conditions that couldn’t be reduced to a photograph like the flag-raising at Iwo Jima.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*KOn-aW068pmdrJvyOHY_Kg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">U.S. Marine Lance Cpl.

Safar Bazaar was once a hotbed for insurgents, its shops teeming with illegal drugs and streets laden with improvised explosive devices. Over the last two years, four Marine infantry battalions and their Afghan National Security Forces counterparts have labored to make it safe. Today, the buzzing bazaar is the commercial hub of southern Garmsir district. Thousands of Afghans from around the district travel to the bazaar each week to purchase goods.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Rather, success in OEF was achieving milestones of limited scope, and making sure that Afghanistan’s government could appear to be functional and legitimate. The headline for the photo to the left is, “From insurgent hotbed to commercial hub: Afghans, Marines clear Safar Bazaar of remnants of illegal activity during Operation Sandman,” and clearly demonstrates the Americans’ goal of making Afghanistan safe for Afghans. That a young boy teaching a 20-year-old Marine how to count in Pashto was an indicator of success. These images convey a calmer tone than many others from the war. With rifles and body armor, Americans have restored an environment of order and peace, one where civilians, even kids, are frequently seen interacting with the soldiers.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*mO6FNfZI-FU-qbhSceduvA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Afghan commandos of the joint force halt a suspected militant from their fighting position, Wardak province, Afghanistan, Oct. 21, 2009.

It became a theme of U.S. military public affairs to showcase Afghan forces. Ultimate success there, after all, would be an Afghan state able to secure its own border and cities with limited U.S. assistance.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*QHDzJp75b3RzGLB_OHfJJA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">U.S. Army Staff Sgt.

Shane Hamann/Released)</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The final major argument of these OEF photographs is that the U.S. is a force that keeps people safe. In Army operations, the principle of “overwatch” is always at play, with soldiers in a tactically superior position are able to keep an eye on routine activities. Snipers maintain overwatch on assault teams; drones keep overwatch on convoys; and all soldiers take turns in an overwatch position guarding their buddies in almost any circumstance.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*zcaVS0ttJQBLflLbcVAlLQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">A member of an Afghan-international security force provides security during clearing operations. The security force set in containment and cleared multiple targets in Suri Kheyl, Zadran District, Afghanistan, August 14, 2010.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>As in the photo above, overwatch signifies a position of omniscience and omnipotence. It is a metaphor for the good guys having your back, so it is comforting in a way. Inherent in the metaphor is that these soldiers — almost all young men — have been adequately and expertly trained to wield the weapons with which they keep us safe.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*1MiqV8NlkZaBWnyZSUUJ8w.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Spc. Ronald Turner provides overwatch protection from atop a hill while other members of his platoon search a village in Mianashin, Afghanistan Oct. 21, 2005.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the subject of Dauber’s essays is turned on its head in these photographs. In the 1990s, conventional wisdom held that the American public was casualty shy, and wouldn’t stand for a long-term conflict in which a stream of America’s young men and women came home in flag-draped coffins. These photos argue that, far from being unsafe and at the mercy of events, these service members are in total control of their environments. They decide who goes home in a coffin, and it is likely to be the enemy.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*4scGjZRsdFYiZq0Pgdz4DQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">PATROL BASE HANJAR, Helmand province, Afghanistan — U.S. Marine Corps Cpl.

But sometimes arguments can appeal to emotion; though many DVIDS photographs depict war memorials or caskets of service members, they aren’t among the most popular.</p>\n<p>It is important to bear in mind that all of these images were produced by military personnel. While this speaks to the DOD’s institutional commitment to documenting the battlefield, and to the technical competence of many service members, it also puts hard limits on the category of photos that one will find in DVIDS. All of the imagery is associated with a “release authority,” who is almost always an officer, and usually a senior one. Many photos are taken, but few are released. And while many photos are simply excluded from release because they are superfluous, redundant, irrelevant, or of poor quality, often photos are withheld from the public because they cast the military in a bad light.</p>\n<p>Defense Department rules and regulations prohibit withholding information simply because it is embarrassing; nevertheless, public affairs officers wear dual hats — public relations and marketing on one hand, and information officers on the other. Moreover, Defense Department guidelines allow withholding of images that might violate security, a rationale that can be used flexibly.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*NZ-mpeZPOw-u_4E20qPMTA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">U.S. Army Sgt.

Are they merely going to a subset of the population that is more likely to support the war anyway? The idea would square with recent scholarship that suggests interaction with the military is becoming less common for a growing number of Americans, that the burden of military service is borne by a narrowing segment of the population. But given that military is held in historically high estimation, perhaps the trends don’t render the analysis meaningless. At any rate, the photos are representative of something, and understanding what that something is has to begin somewhere.</p>\n<p>I have been disappointed in the lack of in depth combat photography and documentary during the past 15 years — a period that should have seen a renaissance in the form. There are notable exceptions, of course, but service members have become the best source of photographs in the theater.</p>\n<p>DVIDS photos represent a collective professionalism that rivals civilian photo journalists, and though they are trained to craft and create propagandistic imagery, they function as journalists to some degree. They gather information. They attempt to inform. They tell the stories of Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors, and Marines in the combat zone. According to Julie Newton, “photojournalists study humankind through their reportage; they are professional observers. But the best journalists are indeed social scientists.”</p>\n<p>DVIDS gives us insight into how an information war is fought, and as ever the American service member is in the middle of the fight.</p>	2015-07-14 19:46:23.901562	2015-07-14 19:46:23.901562	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1200/1*2iCTLkEMD3GgwCebc7Yijg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Since Operation Enduring Freedom was launched in 2001, millions of American soldiers have deployed to…</p>

But what would you? We have only one military prophet; and in as much as the time has not yet come to build his sepulcher, it is perhaps ungracious to cast too many stones at him.”</em></p>\n<p>—Army Quarterly<em>, quoted in </em>Boney Fulle</p>\n<p><em>“In a small way I am trying to do for war what Copernicus did for astronomy, Newton for physics, and Darwin for natural history.”</em></p>\n<p><em>—J. F. C. Fuller, </em>The Foundations of the Science of Wa</p>\n<p>Crisis is fertile ground for creative thinkers. As the science historian Thomas Kuhn has explained, development of scientific knowledge is characterized by brief moments of explosive questioning, competition of ideas, high levels of collaboration, and a “shift in professional commitments.” These debates are not unique to purely scientific communities; in the early 20th century, a period marked by various military, political, economic, and cultural crises, military thinkers debated the fundamental assumptions of their own craft. John Frederick Charles Fuller stands above the rest in his zeal to change the way war was studied.</p>\n<p>Science became authoritative in the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, just when Fuller was engaging in the debates. It shouldn’t be surprising that military professionals would look to the language and method of science to guide their study of warfare; soldiers have a long tradition of attempting to impose a systematic approach to their craft. Three things make Fuller somewhat unique, though: a) he set about to making the study of war a scientific endeavor with a tenacity unmatched by anyone before or since; b) his theories have had lasting impact, particularly on the US military; and c) he drew heavily from mystic works. It is the last of these that might surprise students of miltary science.</p>\n<p>Mysticism’s incursion into the sciences has been well-chronicled. In second half of the 20th century, scholars began pointing out the parallels between Eastern mystic traditions and modern physics. Drawing on thinkers like Sal Restivo, Sean Lawson has described how <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Science-Warfare-complexity-information/dp/0415836859/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1418691324&sr=8-1&keywords=sean+lawson' title='' rel=''>that mode of thought found its way into US military doctrine</a> via an influential American soldier and military thinker, John Boyd. Boyd (incidentally a disciple of Fuller), drew on mysticism in his own work</p>\n<p>Theorists, planners, and fighters of war have long appropriated elements of science, including its language, to improve their profession. And although Fuller was largely responsible for that phenomenon among western militaries in the 20th century, his ideas about and prescriptions for modern war, articulated in the second and third decades of the 20th century, were themselves based partly on ideas he enlisted from mystic traditions and the occult.</p>\n<p>Mysticism, according to Restivo, is an example of “exploration of states of consciousness.” Those who see a connection between science and mysticism find a liberating mode of thought. Fuller, too viewed science as “liberating” and attempted to employ it in his quest to improve the practice of war. He employed concepts inherent in mystic traditions to answer questions even as he labeled his task a scientific undertaking. Fuller didn’t himself advance the argument that mysticism ought to inform a scientific approach, but there was a creeping influence of mysticism on Fuller’s military thinking, regardless of whether Fuller recognized that influence or not.</p>\n<p>Fuller was a prolific writer. Less known among his collected works are three books that summarize his interests in mysticism and the occult: <em>The Star in the West (1907)</em>, <em>Yoga (1925)</em>, and <em>The Secret Wisdom of the Qabalah (1937). </em>These complement his main treatises on “scientific warfare:” <em>Reformation of War (1923), </em>and <em>The Foundations of the Science of War (1926). </em>Though he wrote many more volumes (Anthony Trythall’s bibliography lists 45 books; in addition to the reams of journal articles, military tracts, and popular press pieces). In those writings, he laid out his philosophy of idealism, the concept of cycles, creation, and equilibrium, and the imposition of numbers on problems, including a three-fold order to the universe— all ideas borrowed from his mystic influences</p>\n<p>Fuller saw himself as unconventional. Like all would-be reformers, he had a rebellious streak that he somewhat proudly described as heretical, others more condemningly as insubordinate. By his own account, he began thinking about a scientific application to war in 1911, during which time he was commander of a Territorial Army battalion. He soon became an instructor at the Staff College at Camberley and in 1915 was sent to France as a wartime operations officer. During the war he honed his ideas about how to make war more scientific in study and in practice.</p>\n<p>His quest was marked by departures from conventional thinking. At the end of 1915, for example, he wrote an article for the <em>Journal of the Royal United Services Institute </em>that criticized the British Field Service Regulations in its opening paragraph. Noting that the <em>FSR </em>referred to “the fundamental principles of war,” he then declared</p>\n<>…to publish a revised edition of Euclid and forget the definitions, is to be guilty of somewhat serious omissions; nevertheless, throughout the 434 pages of this text-book on the science and the art of war…no further mention is made as to what these principles are.</>\n<p>It was a justified criticism that laid the groundwork for his later, and more complete, elucidations on the scientific method of studying war. Not only did it demonstrate Fuller’s systematic thinking, but the article introduced the notion that Allied victory depended on penetrating the German line. British military strategy had been, whether ideal or designed in the face of sad reality, to wear down the enemy front. To pierce it was heresy.</p>\n<p>During the war, Fuller served in a number of positions at home and in France. While on the continent, he became convinced that the tank represented a future of armored warfare, one that was well-suited to application of the principles he was discovering. Despite three books to his name and several military journal articles (in addition to various occult pieces and a book dedicated to Britain’s most famous occultist, Aleister Crowley) his 1923 book, <em>Reformation of War</em>, was the most complete outline of his view that “all forms of warfare are founded on a common science.” He was convinced that “the jar of science has been fished up from out the deep, and its seal has been broken, and no English contempt for others will coax the Jinn back into his bottle.” Fuller analogized war with any other human endeavor, expressing the positivist view that it would improve but never disappear. <em>Reformation </em>became a best seller</p>\n<p>Long after the British Army had returned home and begun preparing for peace, Fuller was still at work articulating the principles of war, which he believed could be studied in a scientific way. In 1926 he published <em>The Foundations of the Science of War</em>, in which he added to and elaborated on the principles outlined in his previous work. <em>Foundations </em>represented a highly systematic approach to war, but Fuller characteristically managed to offend many of his contemporaries and superiors, exposing the “prevailing ignorance” of the British Army</p>\n<p>In response to his critics’ view that war could never be other than an art, Fuller replied, “poetry, painting, and music may be arts, but they are based on the sciences of language, of optics, and of acoustics.” <em>Foundations</em>, which Fuller considered his magnum opus, was a mammoth attempt to classify his principles and derive some universal laws from their application that could serve to guide planners of the next war. “Though the scientific method has never as yet been applied to the history of war, truth always exists either openly or hidden.” Fuller was devoted to revealing that truth</p>\n<p>He found truth in a variety of sources. Yoga, qabalah, and the occult all uncovered mysteries and revealed patterns of thinking that translated into a deeper understanding of the battlefield. In <em>Yoga </em>he identifies the law in force and explains the dual nature of fallen man</p>\n<p>The duality found in Fuller’s mysticism is a key to his scientific study of war. In <em>Reformation</em>, he introduces his idea that man’s becoming an active force is a precondition of his freedom (p. 277). In <em>Foundations</em>, he elaborates on the concept, taking as his “archetypical organization” the human body itself, possessed of a control system to exert forces, which come in a pair. In war, it is up to the commander to employ these forces, an active one to exert pressure, or a stable one to resist it (p. 83). Force was at the heart of his conception of war, which was nothing more than the application of force as a political instrument (1926, p. 78). His willingness to divide force into two types emanates from his mystic persuasion</p>\n<p>Even more obvious to students of Fuller than his application of duality, and probably any other aspect of mysticism for that matter, was his tendency to see things in patterns of three, which often invited ridicule from his contemporaries. In <em>The Star in the West</em>, for instance, he tells his reader of the three great commandments: “Know Thyself, Be Thyself, Honour Thyself,” and he divides all of human understanding into three spheres: mysticism, idealism, and realism</p>\n<p>In his treatments of yoga and qabalah, Fuller frequently refers to trinities, both of spiritual and philosophical things. This proclivity is evident in his war theorizing, as well. In <em>Reformation</em>, he mentions three types of war, and three categories of conquest , but he isn’t wedded to the number three, nor does he attribute anything significant or universal to it</p>\n<p>It was in <em>Foundations </em>that he really found his attraction to trinities for all manner of understanding war, dedicating an entire chapter to it. Chapter 3, “The Threefold Order,” opens thusly</p>\n<>I can establish a foundation [to the study of war] so universal that it may be considered axiomatic to knowledge in all its forms… I shall be able to bring the study of war into the closest relationship with the study of all other subjects.</>\n<p>Important elements often occured in threes as Fuller saw them. War was fought, for example, on land, in the air, and by sea. Ground forces were organized into infantry, cavalry, and artillery. But Fuller also offered a more esoteric, and thus more foundational, explanation:</p>\n<>A does not exist apart from B, neither does B exist apart from A, nor can their relationships exist apart from either, since all three exist as a trinity in unity, and it is this triunity which enables us to know. Knowledge is, in fact, based on the universal inference of a threefold order — this is my <em>cogito ergo sum.</em></>\n<p>Fuller also found mystic concepts like the Unknowable and anti-materialism useful in describing war in a scientific way. Among those that have survived are the disorganization as a weapon, and “creative destruction,” popularized among Americans in the 1980s by Boyd.</p>\n<p>War was an important part of the creation cycle, according to Fuller, who wrote in <em>Reformation </em>that “the true purpose of war is to create and not to destroy” and described war as “the god of creative destruction, that grim synthetic iconoclast.” It is interesting to note here that one of John Boyd’s most well-known essays is titled, “Destruction and Creation,” and draws on similar mystic concepts</p>\n<p>Fuller lived during a time of remarkable paradigm shift. After his military career he cited the Theory of Relativity as being responsible for an “extraordinary change between the scientific outlook of the present century and that of the last.” In the old order, “the struggle with the rationalist conception of the world was how to find a place for freedom in a world where all things were determined by law.” In the new scientific order, men would “struggle…to find a place for authority and order in a world of pure chance or pure accident.” He saw himself as a scientific pioneer, one who both recognized the shift and was intellectually equipped to find the order lost in the chaos of war.</p>\n<p>There can be no doubt that J. F. C. Fuller was an intellectual giant in the realm of military theory. Lawson calls him “the world’s leading theorist of mechanized warfare” and “Britain’s foremost military thinker.” Historians generally agree that Fuller had a profound impact on German doctrine and tactics in World War II , on the tactics displayed in the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, and on US Maneuver Warfare doctrine that emerged as a result of Boyd’s work, which culminated in the 1991 Gulf War. His works and their derivatives are still to be found in the curricula of the major US war colleges. Trythall insists that Fuller “will have a lasting relevance principally because he was above all else a brilliant and critical student of war.”</p>\n<p>Fuller earned his reputation as a superb scholar of war because he has been proven right more than wrong. He was unconventional, a self-described heretic, who sought new ways to think about war and execute it. His theories of warfare were forged amid the chaos and calamity of World War I, which caused him and others to “[partake] of strategically black masses and tactical witches’ Sabbaths.” He made it his goal to move beyond alchemy and superstitions to devise a science of war.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the preeminent war scientist was deeply committed to Eastern mystic traditions, and its elements crept in to his work on the task. Yet it isn’t entirely contradictory, since, for Fuller, all systems are but roads to one goal, which was a better understanding of the universe. War was merely Fuller’s experience in that universe.</p>\n<p>The mystic systems Fuller studied — qabalah, yoga, and early in his career Aleister Crowley’s occult versions of them — influenced him in very apparent ways. They infused his outlook with elements of idealism, including notions of the Unknowable and immaterialism; they shaped his belief in cycles of chaos, and of the power of organization; and they instilled in him a predilection to see things in sets of twos and threes.</p>\n<p>Writing of the genealogy of modern law, David Faigman has pointed out, “however reputable science might be today, its roots lie deep in the mystical practices and superstitions of the past.”</p>\n<p>How true for war.</p>	2015-07-14 19:46:24.206027	2015-07-14 19:46:24.206027	<h2>J.

It is troubling, to say the least</p>\n<p>In the interest of being fair and balanced, the Taliban probably doesn’t know how many soldiers they have fighting the government, but we’d hope the Afghan National Army (ANA) would hold themselves to a slightly higher standard.</p>\n<p>And this story is all about standards, really.</p>\n<p>NATO reports that the government in Afghanistan has over 300,000 security forces, which meets an important benchmark. But the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopko, “ found no assurance that these data are accurate.” Sopko and his office go by the acronym SIGAR, a name that would fit easily into a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fan fiction tale (The forces of SIGAR amassed on the borders of Minas Tirith under clouds of destruction), strikes fear into hardened American military commanders with his army of accountants and auditors weilding spreadsheets and ledgers. It’s an information war, after all</p>\n<p>In the West we have become obsessed with the kind of accountability and damning reports that SIGAR represents. Sopko has scrutinized war and rebuilding expenses in Afghanistan using the tools of American finance and management.</p>\n<p>Those efforts are definitely well-placed. SIGAR’s quarterly reports have revealed billions in wasted money — money that could have gone to more efective programs killing insurgents or developing service capacity. In a famous example, the Army spent $3 million on river patrol boats for the Afghans, then simply never sent them. To this day they sit in a warehouse in Virginia. (Two aisles away from Ark of the covenant.)</p>\n<p>But the thrust of the current SIGAR report is the failure of the Afghan government to keep records that meet the standards of modern Western accounting practices. So why is it so hard for the Afghans to deliver reliable data?</p>\n<p>Most obviously, they are still fighting a war. Americans know exactly how many of our soldiers leave and come back. We have accurate rosters and fairly up-to-date readiness records. But we have spent decades developing these systems, and with the luxury of not having to fight in large-scale domestic insurrections while we built them. At the height of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, for instance, we had just shy of 300,000 troops deployed around the world in combat and support operations. That was 13 percent of the then 2.2 million service members. During a domestic insurgency, a much higher percentage of Afghan troops are deployed. They are dying, deserted, retiring, enlisting. It is much more difficult to get accurate numbers for them than it is for us.</p>\n<p>Still, the importance of measuring these things is enormous. The ability of the Afghan Minitry of Defense to account for its personnel is an indicator not only of the end strength of its forces avvailable to fight, but of a general competence of the government to provide basic services.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*-m1XY82wXGy3vWiX7JLjcg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Afghans probably wouldn’t disagree, in principle. Having the data is important, of course. But it’s a matter of priority at the same time. <em>We’ll get to gathering more and better data just as soon as we finish counting our dead and wounded</em></p>\n<p>Two other points bear emphasizing. One is that U.S. and NATO bureaucracies aren’t exactly paragons of good data. The SIGAR demonstrates this perfectly. In the patrol boat episode, SIGAR complained of the military’s frequent “lapses in record keeping.”</p>\n<p>And as the As Newsweek pointed out about the current report,</p>\n<>That report said there was such a lack of coordination among Pentagon, State Department and USAID officials that the U.S. embassy in Kabul “did not become aware of one $39.6 million project until Afghan government officials thanked the Ambassador for U.S. support.”</>\n<p>Second is that the standards set in the SIGAR reports are remarkably high. American businesses find out all the time how hard it is to collect data in order to improve performance. The Afghan government is learning this hard lesson (hopefully).</p>	2015-07-14 19:46:25.004119	2015-07-14 19:46:25.004119	<h3>Why Can’t the Afghan Military Get Good Data?</h3>\n<p>Newsweek <a href='http://www.newsweek.com/taliban-afghanistan-army-326369' title='' rel=''>published an article about the lack of good information regarding the numbers of Afghan troops</a> fighting the insurgency there.

Sophomores in college were in the third grade when the U.S. launched its war in Afghanistan.	2015-03-12 04:14:50	f2d8c083ad06	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/1200/1*TAHWqzOLxfOyo9_WAoFzsg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Sophomores in college were in the third grade when the U.S. launched its war in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>While 9/11 is the defining event for American politics in the 21st century, it is not part of the consciousness of most college-aged people in the same visceral way it is for older Americans. It is an episode to be studied in history classes, rather than in current events.</p>\n<p>The University of <a href='http://peace.utah.edu' title='' rel=''>Utah’s Peace and Conflict Studies Program</a> is hosting a debate and discussion to bring it to the fore once again, and to examine what the U.S. was able to achieve during our nation’s longest military operation</p>\n<p>Our multi-disciplinary program is co-hosting the event with the Hinckley Institute of Politics, the Department of Communication, the Center for International Justice, the John R. Park Debate Society, the Veterans Support Center, the Tanner Center for Human Rights, and the Department of Political Science.</p>\n<p>The diverse sponsors list reflects the range of issues and complexity of the war, which is often misunderstood— if understood at all.</p>\n<p>In October 2001, the U.S. led an international military coalition in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime in response to the attacks of 9/11. On October 7, 2001 allied air strikes bombarded Taliban and al Qaeda targets; on the ground, American, British and other Allied special forces worked with the Northern Alliance to begin a military offensive to take control of that country. These attacks led to the fall of Kabul on Nov. 13, 2001, as the Taliban retreated from most of northern Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>By December of that year, American Army units partnered with Hamid Karzai in southern Afghanistan took the Taliban capital of Kandahar, and quickly established an air base there. As more Allied troops entered the war and the Northern Alliance forces fought their way southward, the Taliban and al Qaeda retreated.</p>\n<p>Operation Enduring Freedom was deemed a success, initially.</p>\n<p>Early on, Coalition political leaders met in Germany, where they approved the Bonn Accords and backed an interim government led by Karzai. In 2004, President Karzai publicly announced the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the culmination of a two-year deliberative process that many stable, Western democracies might envy. Karzai was elected the Republic’s constitutional president.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*DJmdqeFH-qgo8x02UhPoeA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>In 2005 there were 66,000 Afghan security forces, and around 35,000 Coalition forces. It seemed that Afghanistan was approaching stability and independence.</p>\n<p>But by 2006, it appeared that the Taliban had regrouped and threatened the fragile government in Kabul. When President Obama took office in 2009, U.S. military leaders were asking for more resources to prosecute the war. A troop surge was approved, and in 2010, 100,000 Americans were serving in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>By the time Operation Enduring Freedom concluded this past December, the U.S. had spent $686 billion in that country. A study conducted by Brown University estimated that the Afghanistan War will cost $2.2 trillion when the residual costs, such as for veterans health care, are factored in.</p>\n<p>Most sobering, perhaps, over the course of the 13-year war nearly 1900 Americans were killed in combat, and over 2800 coalition troops died in battle. The Taliban insurgency rages on. Still, Afghanistan remains a failed state in seemingly perpetual civil war.</p>\n<p>Was it worth it?</p>\n<p>Debating that proposition are four distinguished academics.</p>\n<p>Prof. Amos Guiora teaches law at the University of Utah S. J. Quinney College of Law and is the Co-Director at the Center for Global Justice. He is widely cited as an expert on national security, counterterrorism, and the limits of military power. He served for 19 years in the Israel Defense Forces as Lieutenant Colonel (retired), and held a number of senior command positions, including Commander of the IDF School of Military Law and Legal Advisor to the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<p>Maj. Matt Cavanaugh is an instructor at the United States Military Academy at West Point in the Defense and Security Studies. He served in combat during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He is a term member at the Council on Foreign Relations, and editor at WarCouncil.org, a site dedicated to the study of the use of force.</p>\n<p>Maj. (Ret.) Roger Perkins leads the growing Veterans Support Center which represents over 1000 veterans on campus. His extensive carreer as an Army intelligence officer includes a tour as Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence at the Army Special Forces Command. He holds a master’s degree in International Relations and Strategic Studies from Boston University and is a graduate of the US Army Command and General Staff College.</p>\n<p>Rich Stowell is a doctoral candidate in communication and a soldier in the Utah National Guard. He recently returned home from a tour in Afghanistan. He has studied and written on the prospects for democracy in in that country, as well as the intersection of the political and the military in counterinsurgency operations.</p>\n<p>Those in favor of the proposition can argue that, on balance, the West has tamped down a swelling of jihadist terrorism in Afghanistan, that al Qaeda does not pose the threat it did 15 years ago, and that there is hope for a democratic American ally in the the region.</p>\n<p>The other side can point out that Afghanistan is still a failed state, as fragile as ever, and that a very expensive and deadly war has merely postponed the resurgence of radical, violent parties there.</p>\n<p>Winners will not be on the panel, though, but rather in the audience— the attentive students who are the next generation of voters, policy amkers, communicators, soldiers, lawyers, and peace activists.</p>	2015-07-14 19:46:25.941488	2015-07-14 19:46:25.941488	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/1200/1*TAHWqzOLxfOyo9_WAoFzsg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Sophomores in college were in the third grade when the U.S. launched its war in Afghanistan.</p>

Its walls are lined with shelves containing an abundnace of wood scraps and hardware. In the middle of the smallish space is a table saw that doubles as a work bench. Tools are scattered about, cords hang from any available hook, and appliances serve mainly as counter space.</p>\n<p>As my professor tells me, “it is not a poster child for 5S.”</p>\n<p>Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardize, Sustain are the Ss to which he refers— staples in workplace organization practice. The clumsy English transliterations from Japanese still do the concept justice. In a word, “orderly.”</p>\n<p>A factory foreman or a contractor knows that a clean workspace is an efficient one, but what about a combat Soldier?</p>\n<p><strong>Order Creates Opportunity</strong></p>\n<p>Now imagine that workshop under the care and supervision of a recently retired seasoned citizen with time to spare. It’s all spiffied up—cords are arranged and labeled. That table saw? It’s a table saw again, because the hardware is put in properly identified bins.</p>\n<p>Now that the lumber is arranged, it is basically inventoried. The tools are at the ready, and the workspace is inviting to the work for which it was created. There are opportunities to build, or repair, or do whatever a retired person has in mind.</p>\n<p>Is the battlefield a workspace? You bet. Good commanders carefully manage the and try to order it, control it. When they have a good inventory (intelligence) of what is available, and the resources maintained and at the ready, they can get to work doing what a military force does best.</p>\n<p>The corollary is that disorder reduces motivation. When military personnel are untrained or improperly employed, insufficient to potential demands, in transit, exhausted, or distracted, they aren’t as useful. When the battlefield is misunderstood by commanders, they are less likley to see opportunities.</p>\n<p>A rule of thumb offered by the professor— you should be able to determine the purpose of a location within five minutes.</p>\n<p>While the time constraint is arbitrary, the idea is sound. Very soon after taking an initial assessment of a battlespace, a knowledgable observer, perhaps an incoming commander, should be able to know what his options are in terms of the job to be done. His resources should be where he’d expect them to be, ready to be used.</p>\n<p><strong>Order Provides Focus</strong></p>\n<p>An orderly workspace is one that maps out the job. But a battlefield can’t really be considered a workspace, can it? Okay, then let’s just consider the space that military personnel control— the post-battle space or the forward operating base and surrounding security zones.</p>\n<p>Once these are established and secured, tasks become much more manageable. Maneuver units are given areas of operation and develop highly localized expertise. Their jobs become clear. If not, then the suite of actions is presented to them in a way that is easy to interpret.</p>\n<p>Of course, disorder produces distraction, so that when chaotic situations erupt, resources go to those events and cause leaders to become reactive instead of proactive.</p>\n<p><strong>Order Reduces the Chances of Injury</strong></p>\n<p>And death. In a military context, order keeps Soldiers alive. In a combat situation, knowing where troops are, where the enemy is, and how much firepower is available reduces the chance that something goes wrong. Of course in battle, things always go wrong, but a well-ordered space is one in which back ups are available.</p>\n<p>Quick reaction forces are like power tools whose batteries are fully charged. Medical personnel are the safety shut off switch for a large piece of machinery. Logistics keeps the hardware within reach so the job can get done.</p>\n<p>5S has helped large organizations—factories, businesses, and even non-profits—develop better, safer, and more efficient workflows. Those principles clearly apply to military operations, and probably with more impact.</p>\n<p>And that’s how a seasoned management communication professor with cluttered basement workshop helps the world’s greatest military understand one tiny aspect of keeping the world… <em>orderly</em></p>	2015-07-14 19:46:26.218317	2015-07-14 19:46:26.218317	<h3>Order Creates Opportunity</h3>\n<p>Imagine a small workshop, maybe typical of one found in a seasoned citizen’s basement.

We’d start by showing them pictures of a bike when they’re young. We’d teach them to say the word “bike,” then spell it, then write it neatly. We’d have them draw a picture of a bike. We’d have them measure the perimeter of a picture of a bike. We’d have them write stories about people riding bikes. We’d ask them to share what kind of bike they want when they grow up.</p>\n<p>When they reached their teens, every once in a while someone would show them a real bike and describe what riding it is like. They wouldn’t be allowed to touch it and certainly not to own or ride one. In fact, anyone who let them would be subject to serious legal trouble. Then, after seventeen or eighteen years of this (never more or less), we’d have a big ceremony congratulating them and ourselves at their successful completion of bike riding prep.</p>\n<p>They’d be allowed to ride now, but it would be looked down upon. Instead, they’d be encouraged to hone their skills and <em>really</em> learn to ride by paying tens of thousands of dollars to spend the next four years getting drunk and hearing specialized bike-related knowledge. They’d hear the history of bikes, mostly from professors who hate bikes. They’d hear about the ecosystem where the rubber trees grow that go into bike tires, except any connection between that ecosystem and the actual building and riding of bikes would be deemed in poor taste. They’d learn a great many other things and come away with a certificate declaring their level of bike preparedness</p>\n<p>We’d celebrate and buy them something (but not a bike). Then they’d go out and try to obtain a bike in a highly competitive market.

Even though the stated goal is to get them riding, it’s not their ability to ride that determines the success of the system, only the number of students who complete it. Figuring out how to ride and riding before the appointed time is a sign of trouble and rebellion, and would be discouraged at all costs.</p>\n<p>This is obviously a stupid way to teach bike-riding, yet <a href='http://blog.discoverpraxis.com/future-of-school/' title='' rel=''>it’s how too many young people are educated for career and life</a></p>\n<p>Get out of the classroom.

Trademark!</h3>\n<p>Dear College Community,</p>\n<p>Now that summer break is in full swing, I’m thrilled to officially announce an exciting and forward-looking new office. No, it’s not the Circumlocution Office! — I knew you professors would say that. It’s the Office of Flourishing™, and it’s here to make sure that Team Leader administrators like myself work in synergy with faculty and students on our key deliverable of never-ending joy.</p>\n<p>The Office of Flourishing™ is part of the university-wide Strategic Restructuring Project™, which aims by 2030 to reduce all academic departments to a single Office of Education, a subsidiary to the Office of Development and Alumni Donations. We’re so impressed with all of you instructors and your knowledge about things, but we’re not sure that we need quite<em> </em>so many of you, even though you look great peppered around campus — especially in publicity photos</p>\n<p>But as we work towards that goal, we hope to involve you in our Plan for Campus Joy™. Our office strives to radiate exhilaration and progress as we forge ahead into a glorious and advanced future for Student-Clients™ embarking on their Meaningful Lives™. We want them to build rewarding relationships with other human beings just like themselves, manage the occasional stress that can arise in our ComfortPlus™ campus environment, and feel that their lives have a point, even though they do not yet have corporate jobs.</p>\n<p>This spring, you may have already seen the hard work of the Office of Flourishing™ in our Motivational Quote Initiative, which has invested in displaying brightly-colored posters all over the quad, transforming the university into a self-help book! <em>Life has ups and downs, and you accept this because it is true</em> is my favorite.<em> </em>That is the kind of profound observation our office is capable of delivering</p>\n<p>Because we value the humanities, we have also organized a series of extra-curricular workshops for the fall, including Shakespeare’s Guide to Being a Better Manager (hint: Be a man!), What Chaucer Has To Say About Your Business Journey, and Team Leadership Inspiration from King Arthur’s Knights of the Round Table. Please encourage your students to sign up at the new Babbitt School of Business.</p>\n<p>We’re communicating with you because we want our initiatives to be transparent — and I don’t mean like the dress I probably shouldn’t have worn to the Goodbye Department of Romance Languages Garden Party. I can tell you I won’t wear it to Benefit That Will Not Benefit Adjuncts next Saturday!</p>\n<p>By now you’re probably wondering: When can faculty members find time to Flourish™? It’s particularly hard for female faculty, struggling to balance work and family. Whew! That must be exhausting. Unfortunately, due to the investment in this office, there’s no possibility of a childcare center on campus, so please stop sending e-mails to that effect.</p>\n<p>Here in the Office of Flourishing™, we believe you must take control of your life <em>on your own</em>, but also with the help of our office, which is staffed by four people — the same as the number of full-time Classics faculty! Professors, we want to help you to Flourish™ while you’re filling out forms, or Writing Mission Statements to justify the existence of your humanities department, or devising “learning outcomes” so the deans can better understand what a grade really means. You can also Flourish™ while you’re investing in your career by planning your own research and conference travel without the hassle of obtaining university funding, or by planning the next exciting step in your Flourishing Journey™ once your Visiting Assistant Professor position expires next year. And of course you can Flourish™ in the knowledge that we’re re-branding the salary freeze of the last ten years as the Professors Love Their Jobs And Thus Don’t Need Raises Initiative.</p>\n<p>But because we want to reward you educators in a manner that isn’t grossly material, we’re developing an exciting new program in conjunction with the Office of Over-Advising™ that will give you the opportunity to spend several days in the dorms with students: braiding their hair, having pillow fights, piercing their ears with safety pins, and singing “Kumbaya.”</p>\n<p>Like you, students can Flourish™ in their day-to-day lives. Please encourage them to Flourish™ by not dwelling on their education debt, or their lack of career opportunities, or their fears of life beyond our supportive community. They can also Flourish™ by avoiding binge drinking — especially at fraternities! (What are we going to do with those places?!) — and by eating their delicious meals provided by Aramark, food purveyor to prisons and cults located deep in the woods.</p>\n<p>Fab Nutrition is only one of the very important Lucky Seven Key Steps to Flourishing™ that we’ve devised for students, along with Your Weird Emotions, Money Stuff, Sorta Future Job Stuff, Social Life What-Have-You’s, Spiritual Malarkey, and Your Marginalized Education. Other Fab Nutrition options include the myriad tasty, global offerings of our campus food court. (Please note that all the university’s food service workers and janitorial staff, as well as the facilities and maintenance staff, will not be Flourishing™ as their parents have not paid the Flourishing Fee™.)</p>\n<p>Our office strives for wellbeing, although we don’t strive to put a hyphen in the word “wellbeing.” Punctuation is silly. We’re working in conjunction with the Library to re-launch it this fall as the Space of Wellbeing (patent pending), where students will be offered on-demand back massages, herbal tea, pet dolphins, and the constant reassurance that they will go far in life because they’re just great. We’re also planning to install a stunning unicorn statue at the entrance to the building. This magical creature is the first step in our Happier Mascot Initiative™, which aims to replace the university’s Not Happy Lion™.</p>\n<p>Finally, we’ll also be coordinating Super Fun Creative Fridays™ for the fall, where members of the campus community can gather together to paint pretty pictures. Art is important — as a hobby, of course. We hope this will relieve the stress you and your fellow faculty members have reported “as a result of receiving constant infantilizing and inane e-mails from absurd, lavishly-funded offices of rainbows and puppies.”</p>\n<p>Cordially,</p>\n<p>Esmerelda Stooge, Director, Office of Flourishing™</p>	2015-07-14 19:48:53.322386	2015-07-14 19:48:53.322386	<h3>Your Flourishing University.

It was eight am, and that tenth day of the month marked a clear and definitive departure from what had been a comfortable and well compensated career as a flight paramedic.</p>\n<p>Looking at my student handbook, sitting prominently on the desk in front of me, my name was written in a small white font in the upper left corner of a dark grey plastic binder. It was followed by a five digit number, then a specific letter and number combination: MFA: CNF, MA, RA, 36.</p>\n<p>I had seen her walk in the room, and purposely did not give more than a polite appraisal. But as the commanding voice of The Legend began, one of this countries most well respected, best selling literary icons and part time senior faculty of the program, I had absolutely no clue what that specific word and letter combination signified. After a quick scan of the room, viewing the nineteen very tight, expressionless faces, each attempting to portray their own brand of cool detachment, I felt assured I was not alone in my lack of knowledge.</p>\n<p><em>“If you will look to your binders, following your name is a list of random numbers and letters. Though I assure you, they are neither random, nor insignificant. The first three, you should recognize as your enrolled program. Followed by your declared focus, that being fiction, poetry, drama for the stage, screen writing, creative-non-fiction, and literature for children.”</em></p>\n<p>The last three words gave the impression there was a small dog turd on the end of her nose. Clearly, The Legend was not a fan of the genre.</p>\n<p><em>“The next two signify your highest educational achievement, followed by your entrance stream. Undergraduate or masters preparation, and wet behind the ears or returning adult.”</em></p>\n<p>Clearly, The Legend was of the life long learner ilk, and being safely on this side of returning adult, exactly eleven of us sighed. We had made one right choice anyway.</p>\n<p><em>“And we conclude with number of years on the planet, your age. You should know, with very few exceptions, the more you have of each value, the better your chance of success in this program. An advanced self insight and open view of the nuances of human behavior will help greatly with that goal. And since writers are loathe to give advice, as never forget, we are always a competitive field, that concludes my welcome, introduction, and for lack of a better term, free tip session.”</em></p>\n<p>Nervous, tentative laughter followed from some of us.</p>\n<p>A smile, one that appeared to actually reach across the podium, slid over the face of The Legend. An objective, arms length critique revealed a clearly stunning older woman with a more than commanding presence. I recall being keenly aware for the first time that morning, The Legend actually had a name. Which she immediately introduced herself as, welcoming us to the first day of the 2006 MFA program in creative writing. Her visibly altered affect obvious, we each relaxed, took a breath. Then, to add tension to an already exceedingly tension filled moment, we received our instructions. Tell each other “who we were.”</p>\n<p><em>“And please, don’t say you are happy to be here. We know that. You told us in the interview. At length.”</em></p>\n<p>Her running commentary proving the last Globe & Mail review to be more than accurate. The Legend really could freeze fire with an appropriately phrased word and stroke of her hair.</p>\n<p>Fuck me! Make it good, I told myself. The margin for error seems rather slim.</p>\n<p><em>“I assume it too be obvious, that I don’t mean tell us your sign. Be original, that’s why you are here. Let’s begin with the woman in blue, front row, far left.”</em></p>\n<p>The woman in blue was very smooth, I recall. Though I have no idea what she said. Or if it was in fact, even English. I was busy rehearsing what I would string together that sounded halfway formed.</p>\n<p><em>“Last row, the gentleman in plaid shorts with the sandals. Who it seems, strolled here from the beach.”</em></p>\n<p>As it slowly dawned on me that she was in fact referencing none other than myself, I made a quick decision and sealed it. Playing off the taken-by-surprise effect, I strung together the sort of random, but intentional string of unconnected traits. Something like:</p>\n<p><em>“36, only child, in many ways hopelessly privileged, though no doubt in compensation for the hopelessly common name of Allan; trust me, that explains much.”</em></p>\n<p>My expertly honed trait of the one eyebrow lift, neatly placed the period on the phrase, and I felt the disarming, yet mild self effacement proved successful, so I continued, stringing together a few more random but appropriately relevant things. It was a balance skill. One consisting of generous offerings of restrained personal information. The expectation was a delicate combination of enough, but never, ever too much.</p>\n<p>The Legend zeroed in for the close.</p>\n<p><em>“And tell us, Allan, has anyone been lucky enough to snag the plaid and sandal wearing beach dweller.”</em></p>\n<p>The tone was brutal, but suggested more playfulness than challenge, yet offered no assurance either way. Meeting in the middle with an approach that shared the limelight, though didn’t defer, seemed the expected response. And the expected response, whatever it was, was crucial. This much I knew. I had done my research, and none of this was in any way unexpected.</p>\n<p><em>“Snagged? I suppose, yes. But lucky?” </em>The pause felt exaggerated, but they always do</p>\n<p><em>“He’d have to tell you</em>.” The answer casually affected, yet at personal risk</p>\n<p><em>“Does ‘he’ have a name?” </em>The response was inviting, not condescending</p>\n<p><em>“David”,</em> I answered</p>\n<p><em>“Ah, a namesake from the classics. Thank you Allan. I’m guessing you are already making the name anything but common”</em></p>\n<p>Her smile, unrestrained. Then, to all of us, she offered, <em>“You’ll find we become, by necessity, a rather close group. Blessing and curse.”</em></p>\n<p>In different ways, and with variant effect, that playful and casual, but oh so intentional banter, was done with each of us. While the welcome was certainly not equal, no one was admonished, nor made an example of what not to do or say. The take away vibe was clearly offered as a Teachable Moment.</p>\n<p>Months later, we would discuss the idea that each response had been crafted to place us exactly where we needed to be, both socially and mentally. The specific comfort zone that was uniquely ours, had been showcased, validated, approved of, and released into the group. All in a two minute casual banter.</p>\n<p>Ask any of the nineteen students present on that early September morning, and the answer will be the same.

Until yesterday, the medical research operation had been one of the major initiatives inside of Google X. So Page’s declaration is the de-facto “graduation” of this enterprise from the moonshot-loving research division. You can even say that this graduation is <em>magna cum laude</em>, because now it will be a company, albeit a fully owned subsidiary of Alphabet</p>\n<p>I have gotten confirmation that the current leader of Life Sciences, Andrew Conrad, will continue to run the operation, presumably as one of Page’s quasi-independent CEOs. In establishing the company as an entity in itself, Conrad has some advantages in that some of his projects have already taken on powerful partners. The flagship venture at Life Sciences is a bold attempt at early disease detection that involves releasing smart nanoparticles in the bloodstream, which can identify markers of nascent heath issues, and signal the user through a wearable device. Conrad describes the system as similar to the Star Trek “Tricorder” which instantly diagnoses one’s ailments. He’s working with Stanford and MIT. (You can learn about it in <a href='https://medium.com/backchannel/were-hoping-to-build-the-tricorder-12e1822e5e6a' title='' rel=''>this interview I did with Conrad.</a>) Other projects include a smart contact lens (in partnership with Novartis) and the organization of a “<a href='http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-collect-data-to-define-healthy-human-1406246214' title='' rel=''>Baseline Study</a>” to establish the genetic parameters of what a healthy person is. (Partners include Duke and Stanford.) [UPDATE: the day after the Alphabet announcement, DexCom, a company whose mission is “to help move health care from reactive to proactive,” <a href='http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dexcom-to-collaborate-with-the-life-sciences-team-at-google-on-the-development-of-breakthrough-technologies-to-change-the-future-of-diabetes-management-300126661.html' title='' rel=''>announced a partnership</a> with Life Sciences to develop advanced glucose monitoring technology.</p>\n<p>Life Sciences might be the perfect case to gauge whether Page’s portfolio scheme has its intended purpose of less bureaucracy and faster innovation. As the leader of Life Sciences, how much time will Conrad be spending on tasks related to running a company as opposed to research that takes advantage of his unique skills? And while a good deal of the activity at Life Sciences is biological lab work that has had little to do with the rest of Google, some of its projects rely heavily on artificial intelligence and data mining. Up until now, engineers in those fields could move freely between Google X and other areas of Google. It’s not clear how much of that fungibility will exist under the new structure. We also don’t have an idea of how Google plans to charge these new companies for shared resources like data centers. (I’m assuming that “Google Classic,” the part of the company with search, ads, Android, and YouTube, retains possession of the infrastructure. But Alphabet hasn’t gone into that degree of detail in its explanation.)</p>\n<p>In any case, establishing Life Sciences as a separate company under the Alphabet umbrella may wind up being one of the most important legacies of this shift — in terms of Alphabet finances and our future health.</p>	2015-08-28 03:00:42.50084	2015-08-28 03:00:42.50084	<p>Buried in the Alphabet announcement was a significant piece of news: one of the new portfolio companies in Larry Page’s Scrabble game is Life Sciences.

63	6	Advice to Ambitious Young People: Just Build Something!	“I’m an ambitious young person who wants to always be moving forward in my education and career. What should I be doing?”	2015-07-02 00:12:32	32316dab99be	<>Photo Credit: <a href='https://unsplash.com/thomaslefebvre' title='' rel=''>Thomas Lefebvre</a></>\n<p><em>“I’m an ambitious young person who wants to always be moving forward in my education and career. What should I be doing?”</em></p>\n<p>Building something.</p>\n<p>The best thing that an ambitious young person can do at age 18, 19, or 20 is to be building something. They should be spending as much of their free time as possible actively contributing to a tangible, real project that is completely outside of the school setting.</p>\n<p>Actively building something is the best thing ambitious young people can do for their personal and professional development. It makes them better people, sets them up for better career opportunities, and sets in process the long and worthwhile goal of becoming creators who are motivated by their own desire to control their lives — not simply by resume padding or job offers from major corporations.</p>\n<p><em>“But I just spent the past couple of years building up my personal accomplishments and resume so that I could get more opportunities…how is your advice any different?”</em></p>\n<p>If you were like me when I was in high school, a good chunk of your time “building” was devoted towards activities and extracurriculars you were hoping would bolster your resume for applying to elite colleges or programs. Sure, you may have really liked some of them, but your time was likely split between a half-dozen or more of these. Even if you were president of your FBLA chapter, a debater on your student congress team, and a member of your Science Olympiad team,<a href='http://zakslayback.com/2015/05/05/do-less-in-the-pursuit-of-more-in-education/' title='' rel=''> you spent so much of your time curating a diverse resume</a> that it was hard to really become an <em>expert </em>at building in any given area</p>\n<p>Or maybe you participate in a few hackathons a year where you build apps and programs within 24 hours in the hopes of beating out other teams and gaining the recognition brought with that. Developing the skill set necessary is itself an astonishing tool and one you can use to build even better and more diverse projects at the end of the day. But <a href='http://zakslayback.com/2015/05/29/the-o-b-s-c-e-n-i-t-y-of-spelling-bees/' title='' rel=''>why are you building?</a> Are you building for the satisfaction of engaging in meaningful work? Or are you building for the approval of some outside authority</p>\n<p>An app, a book, a blog, a podcast, a building, a program — whatever it is, starting (or joining) a project that allows you to actively build is the best thing you can do for yourself and your future. If even as a side-project during school, in the summer, or outside of your full-time job, starting to build can be the best action you can start to make yourself a better person, student, and creator.</p>\n<h3><strong>Personal Development: Building is Hard</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Engaging in the active pursuit of building is not something easy. Waking up and committing to making some headway on a project that you started in a fit of inspiration is easy in the days immediately following the genesis but <a href='http://blog.discoverpraxis.com/entrepreneurship-braving-the-deep-end/' title='' rel=''>becomes increasingly difficult</a> a week, month, or quarter after you started</p>\n<p>Even more, we must develop the standards for success (and failure!) of the building ourselves. Each major decision can be taken dozens of ways, each one bringing with it a set of different outcomes (seen and unseen) and other decisions to be made down the road. It is unlikely there will be obvious “right” and “wrong” options. Some provide more favorable predicted outcomes than others, but how we determine which outcomes are more favorable and likely than others is a decision we have to make.</p>\n<p>When we are in school or a hierarchical workplace, we have people to check our progress and provide a rubric for success. Multiple choice tests provide keys to tell which answers are clearly correct and incorrect. Even open ended answers have rubrics to assist in grading. Answers with certain clear elements are more right than those without these elements.</p>\n<p>Building your own project doesn’t bring with it these same checks. You have to build them yourself. You have to set the standard for success and failure and be prepared to adjust accordingly in light of new information that you determine is worth paying attention to.</p>\n<p>This takes <a href='http://blog.discoverpraxis.com/want-to-become-a-better-person-start-with-entrepreneurship/' title='' rel=''>responsibility and drive</a>. It takes the ability <a href='http://blog.discoverpraxis.com/the-habit-is-the-way/' title='' rel=''>to develop a habit</a> of creation and success. It takes being willing to do something very difficult</p>\n<p>Even if your project is a flop, your undertaking the project will not be a failure if you actively follow the self-guidance of creation — setting goals, checking those goals against self-set standards, and actively working towards building every day.</p>\n<h3><strong>Professional Development: The Age of the Credential Is In Its Twilight</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most of the building that ambitious young people do in their youth is in pursuit of some kind of credential. The credential, it is believed, will show that they know their stuff and ought to be trusted to create and build — either by joining a company or by joining the next tier of higher education.</p>\n<p>This mythos is growing weaker by the day. The importance and weight of actually building a project is stronger than ever with the advent of the Internet and the ability to see for yourself what people have built and the quality of their work with a simple Google search.</p>\n<p>Career pages at company websites echo this assertion. Portfolio and experience requirements are posted in lieu of BA requirements. “BA or equivalent work experience” is found when just years ago “BA” would be all that was listed.</p>\n<p>Employers and potential colleagues are looking for your ability to identify a valuable pursuit, cut your losses when necessary, launch a project in line with that pursuit, carry through, and develop the skills and responsibility necessary to finish that pursuit. An actual track-record of creating speaks more than a simple credential ever could.</p>\n<h3><strong>Motivational Development: Creation Begets Creation</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>“Okay, but where can I start? What if I don’t have a great idea for a project I want to build?”</em></p>\n<p>Just start building.</p>\n<p>Author Steven Pressfield writes of the morning routines of the best writers in his book <em>The War of Art</em>, noting that the “professionals” don’t wait for inspiration to strike and then start working. They just start working. Creation begets creation. Building begets building</p>\n<p>Start building by blogging every day. Start building by learning a new skill set. Start building by devoting yourself an hour to sit down and write no matter what — even if you don’t have a topic. You’ll find in time that a topic will come to you.</p>\n<p>If you devote yourself to launching a new company and actually put in motion the pieces necessary to bring it into reality, you’ll find new motivation to learn the skills you need.</p>\n<p>Engaging in meaningful work motivates the individual. It creates a feedback loop by which we become more motivated to better ourselves in the pursuit of our work. If we find creating an app to be fulfilling and meaningful but require a new coding skill set to get to the next phase of the project, it is astonishingly easier to pick up this skill set than if we just decided to learn it in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself agreeing with the advice to just be building but have no idea what to build, then just start on the path of building <em>something</em>. You’ll be amazed at the motivation and creativity you unlock in the pursuit of building</p>\n<p><em>Zachary Slayback is the Business Development Director for <a href='http://discoverpraxis.com/' title='' rel='nofollow'>Praxis</a>, a ten-month program for entrepreneurial learners.

64	6	How My Son Learned to Read When We Stopped Trying to Teach Him	For a year or more we fought with a kid who clearly had all the tools to read, and we got nowhere.	2015-07-02 00:07:32	b62f0d2fc16b	<p></p>\n<>Photo Credit: <a href='https://unsplash.com/alejandroescamilla' title='' rel=''>Alejandro Escamilla</a></>\n<p>We were homeschooling, and our son was six years old. He had a good vocabulary and comprehension of ideas beyond many kids his age. We knew reading would open up the world to him, we knew he’d like it, and we knew he was very capable of doing it. But he didn’t.</p>\n<p>We tried flashcards. We tried read-alongs. We tried playing hardball and we tried being fun and exciting. We tried restricting activities until he’d done his reading lessons, and we tried giving rewards. All these efforts had two things in common: they didn’t help him read one bit, and they made our relationship with him worse. Being a parent and being a child cease to be fun when you’re at odds all the time.</p>\n<p>So, at an age when we were starting to worry about his lagging behind, we simply stopped trying. We quit the whole effort. He was nearly seven when we gave it up in favor of more peace and harmony in the house.</p>\n<p>Daily life was a little easier, yet we still had this nagging worry about him. What will happen if he’s behind where he’s supposed to be for his age? Still, everything about our efforts to make him read felt wrong, so we simply ignored the fears.</p>\n<p>I was reading a lot of great books on how kids learn and I knew intellectually that kids need no instruction to learn to read. They will learn when they find it valuable and if they are in an environment where it’s possible — one with books and other readers. Still the head and the heart are very different things. I knew kids were better at self-teaching than being taught, but I had to watch my own son, sharp as he was, remain completely outside the wonderful world of the written word.</p>\n<p>Then it happened, just like so many of the books said it would. You believe it in stories, but it’s still a surprise when it happens in real life. One night I overheard my son reading aloud to himself in his bed. And the first thing he read wasn’t Dick and Jane, but Calvin & Hobbes. Not light fare for a brand new reader.</p>\n<p>Let me back up a bit. We would often read to him for a few minutes before bed, and lately he had been in love with some old Calvin & Hobbes comics I had from my adolescence. We’d read him a few pages and say goodnight. One night it was later than usual and he asked me if I’d read. I was a bit grumpy and tired, and I said no, I was going to bed. He protested a bit but could see I wasn’t up for it so he let it go, seeming defeated. Ten minutes later I heard him reading.</p>\n<p>He later told me that he wasn’t actually reading it that night, nor the first several nights after when he spoke the words (and often laughed) aloud. He had heard us read it so many times he had the words memorized. He was looking at the pictures and reciting the words like lines to a familiar song. I didn’t know this until long after he could clearly read without first memorizing, but it really doesn’t matter. In fact, it’s probably better that my wife and I assumed he was reading it when we first heard him, or we might have been tempted to intervene and try to cajole him into reading it without the cheat of memory and illustrations. I know too well the kind of unhappy outcome that would have created.</p>\n<p>For a year or more we fought with a kid who clearly had all the tools to read, and we got nowhere. He wasn’t faking his inability — he really couldn’t read. Reading was always an activity that interrupted his day and was associated with expectant and often visibly (despite attempts to hide it) stressed parents. It was a concept as useless as it was foreign. But once he had a strong desire — to enjoy his favorite comic strip — and his inability to read was the barrier, he overcame it in no time and never even celebrated or announced it to us. It was utilitarian, not some lofty thing to perform for a gold star or a pat on the back. His ability and interest in reading, then writing and spelling, only intensified as he found it indispensable for playing games like Minecraft and Scribblenauts.</p>\n<p>We’ve since made a full transition from the imposed curriculum of homeschooling to the kid-created structure of unschooling. Looking back, I’m a little ashamed of the silly way we approached things before, but at the time it was so hard to let go with all that crippling fear. There are so many “shoulds” pumped into parents’ brains from the moment they conceive. There are percentiles and averages and tests and rankings galore. But these are useful only to the statisticians, and none of them have your child’s interest or happiness in mind. Aggregates aren’t individuals. Living your life, or attempting to shape your child’s life, to conform to the average of some population is not a recipe for success. At best it will produce blandness, at worst a broken spirit.</p>\n<p>You can read any number of thinkers like <a href='http://www.johnholtgws.com/how-children-learn/' title='' rel=''>John Holt</a>, <a href='https://www.johntaylorgatto.com/' title='' rel=''>John Taylor Gatto</a>, or <a href='https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201002/children-teach-themselves-read' title='' rel=''>Peter Gray </a>on why our son’s experience is not exceptional, but normal. You can look at studies that show kids who learn to read at age four and kids who learn at age nine have the same reading comprehension by age 11. You can get story after story from places like the <a href='http://www.sudval.org/' title='' rel=''>Sudbury Valley</a> school about kids who taught themselves to read in a few short weeks once they got the interest, and even one girl who didn’t become interested until age 13 and then went on to win a literary prize. But it’s all theory and myth until you experience it with your own child</p>\n<p>Read the books. Look into the unschooling movement and literature. But above all, take a step back from your own kids and realize that they are only young once and for such a short time. Do you really want your memories with them to consist of fights and forced lessons? Enjoy them. Let them go their own way and navigate the world. There are few things more exciting than when they come to you to ask for your help or insight because they really want it, or when they never do because they figure it out on their own and gain a confidence that cannot be won any other way.</p>\n<p>The world we live in does not lack for natural incentives to learn to read. The rewards are massive, as are the costs of illiteracy. We don’t need to artificially incentivize reading the way a poor farmer might have a few hundred years ago. When we do we do more harm than good, if not to our children’s ability to read then at least to our enjoyment of our time with them. They figured out how to speak — the most difficult, nuanced, and complex skill a human can master — without any formal instruction. They can learn to read too.</p>\n<p><a href='https://twitter.com/isaacmorehouse' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Isaac Morehouse</a> has tried just about every form of education and has spent years building and running educational programs and mentoring students.

55	6	Why Hypermasculinity is Ruining The Men in Our Lives	by Marina Ali — Follow @MarinaAli	2015-07-07 02:09:32	ac097204f83	<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>by <a href='http://www.browngirlmagazine.com/?s=Marina+Ali' title='' rel=''>Marina Ali</a> — </strong><a href='https://twitter.com/MarinaAli' title='' rel=''>Follow @MarinaAli</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>My little brother and I have always been close, even when we were little babies. I’ve watched him grow from a chubby, cuddly little toddler to a tanned, jaunty middle schooler.</h4>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>As he matures in this world, I sometimes get the urge to protect him from the harsh aspects of reality. Realistically, this is impossible. No matter how much I want to consider him my “little kitty,” I know that I can’t shelter him from all the horrible things in the world, like pain or injustice.</p>\n<p>It bothers me to no end that he will, if he hasn’t already, be expected to “act like a man” or “man up” in social situations. He will be told to hide his emotions, to show no weakness, as these tacit shards of advice will keep him from becoming a true man. People around him will tell him that it is okay to call a girl a “slut” or a “bitch” if he’s rejected by her or if she’s showing some skin. He may also learn how to casually put in a sexist or rape joke to make his “boys” laugh. He may try to hide pieces of his personality that seem too feminine, and even think that homophobic names like “faggot” are funny to throw around at other guys who show some kind of effeminate tendency.</p>\n<h4>It scares me to think about the harshness of our patriarchal society and its effect on men. The signs of gender inequality are obvious in women, but in men, it’s much more subtle, yet just as corrosive.</h4>\n<h4></h4>\n<p>A patriarchal gender system puts the male ideal over the female. Thus, anything that relates to women, like housework, child-rearing, or even simply being clean, is trivialized and put down.</p>\n<p>Men who don’t fit into the traditional role of masculinity are ignored and are seen as weak as the women who are being mocked. On top of that, men are constantly told to garner respect and be a leader. If he loses respect and is the omega in anything, then he’s just not manly enough. In this way, violence is thought of as a suitable mode to regain lost masculinity. This is why we constantly hear about more men are put behind bars for gang violence or abuse women to show their manliness.</p>\n<p>The patriarchy’s effect on the men in our lives is way more subversive than we have known before. I don’t have to tell you this in order for you to visualize this issue; you’ve no doubt seen it before your eyes.</p>\n<h3>Don’t believe me? Check this out:</h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>Mainstream, sane feminism has tried to destroy the existence of gender roles for the sexes. Back when civilization was being built up by our ancestors, gender roles were necessary for sustaining the next generation of humans. Now, at the advent of new technology and a burgeoning population, we don’t need them.</p>\n<p>A woman doesn’t have to stay at home to make babies when machines and plastic diapers can do it for her. And likewise, a man doesn’t have to be out, hunting for his family’s sustenance when there are grocery stores and factory farms.</p>\n<p>These notions of how, what, and why an individual should act based on his or her gender are just reiterations of our primordial past as hunters and gatherers. These ideas have infiltrated all parts of our society and have caused deep rifts in the way that people of all genders are perceived. Newer generations of humans have to simply realize, that outdated ways of living won’t work on an industrialized planet.</p>\n<h4>Gender roles are just an Old World notion that we have to shake off, regardless of whatever political or religious ideology you believe in.</h4>\n<h4></h4>\n<p>Instead of being labeled breadwinners or homemakers, men, women, and everyone in between the archaic gender binary, is simply a human being who has the responsibility of not being an asshole to other people. It’s as easy as that.</p>\n<p>Our existence is no longer about fighting off saber tooth tigers and trying to build primitive huts. So, let’s quit perpetuating the gender roles of our cave people ancestors. It’s for the new generation of thinkers, leaders, and builders to take the reins of social change towards gender equality.</p>\n<h4>Hypermasculinity hurts all males, and it’s a choking culture. I don’t want my little brother and males everywhere to have to deal with roles and responsibilities they didn’t sign up for.</h4>\n<h4></h4>\n<p>Paying the bills doesn’t make my brother a man, and hitting and subjugating other women will never show how well his leadership and control skills are. He and every other male on this planet should not feel that their existence and their right to be a man is invalidated, because he dresses a certain way or chooses to cry over something that he is passionate about.</p>\n<p>My brother shouldn’t have to worry about being friends with other women because he will be considered “whipped” or a “pussy” for trying to exercise the natural friendship between men and women. More importantly, he should never think that it’s okay to devalue another male, just because he wasn’t born a man.</p>\n<h4>My fellow Millennials, I call on all of you to start changing the thought process of the boys and girls of the future.</h4>\n<h4></h4>\n<p>We’re all sick of the patriarchal, sexist culture that our forefather/mothers have left behind. They ruined the economy and left us with shitty gender biases. It is time for us to reclaim our lives and our gender identities.</p>\n<p>From now on, think about the lasting effects of calling someone a “pussy” or a “bitch,” and keep negative homophobic/transphobic ideas out of your language. Just respect other people, and never be afraid to express your gender and sexual identity. Together, we can build a better world, but we have to start with baby steps.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/800/0*DyeYA5JYN9yRnSjZ.jpg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><em>Marina Ali is a biomedical engineering and pre-med student at Georgia Tech.

59	6	How to Fix High Poverty High Schools	Affluent high schools have three things lower-income schools lack, says a new study.	2015-07-08 15:24:03	fc5c8430096a	<p>Affluent high schools have three things lower-income schools lack, says a new study.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>By Anne Kim</em></p>\n<p>A recent <a href='http://www.pellinstitute.org/downloads/publications-Indicators_of_Higher_Education_Equity_in_the_US_45_Year_Trend_Report.pdf' title='' rel=''>report</a> from the nonprofit Pell Institute found jaw-dropping disparities in college-going and college completion rates based on a student’s family income</p>\n<p>Among students from households in the bottom income quartile (those earning less than $34,160 a year), just 45 percent go on to college — and only 9 percent eventually earn a bachelor’s degree. Among students from households in the top quartile, in contrast, 82 percent go on to college and 77 percent graduate.</p>\n<p>Now a new <a href='http://www.clasp.org/resources-and-publications/publication-1/CollegeReadinessPaperFINALJune.pdf' title='' rel=''>report</a> from <a href='http://www.clasp.org/' title='' rel=''>CLASP</a> helps shed light on why such glaring gaps exist. It also offers a blueprint for the specific resources that high-poverty schools need to help more students prepare for and succeed in college</p>\n<p>CLASP analyzed more than 2,200 high schools from the nation’s 100 largest school districts and compared them by poverty level. Together, these schools serve more than 3 million students nationwide. What it found was that “high poverty” high schools — where 75 percent or more of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch and are moreover disproportionately African-American and Latino — consistently lack specific resources essential for college-bound students.</p>\n<p>In particular:</p>\n<p>• <strong>High-poverty schools have lower-quality teachers.</strong></p>\n<p>11.5 percent of teachers in high-poverty schools aren’t certified, and roughly 1 in 7 are novices, teaching in their first or second year. Among the most affluent schools, however, the overwhelming majority of teachers are both experienced and certified. Just 3.5 percent of teachers in low-poverty schools — schools where 25 percent or fewer of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch — lack certification.</p>\n<p>“Low-income schools typically get new teachers coming straight out of their teacher preparation programs,” says Rhonda Bryant of the Moriah Group, the report’s lead author. “These new teachers don’t have an opportunity to hone their skills, and they’re placed in some of the most challenging teaching environments, which is problematic.”</p>\n<p>• <strong>High-poverty schools offer fewer college preparatory classes in math and science.</strong></p>\n<p><a href='http://www.clasp.org/resources-and-publications/publication-1/CollegeReadinessPaperFINALJune.pdf' title='' rel=''>One in six</a> high-poverty high schools don’t offer Algebra II; three in five don’t offer calculus, and nearly one in three don’t offer physics. Among wealthy schools, in contrast, these offerings are near universal. For example, just six percent of the most affluent schools don’t offer Algebra II</p>\n<p>Bryant says the lack of higher-level math and science classes means that lower-income students are forced to take remedial coursework when they get to college. “That’s particularly detrimental to low-income students because those remedial courses eat up their Pell Grants — their financial aid money — and don’t count toward their degree program,” says Bryant. “A higher number of low-income students drop out of college because they realize they’re no closer to having their degree than when they started.”</p>\n<p>• <strong>High-poverty schools suffer from a shortage of guidance counselors.</strong></p>\n<p>Students in high-poverty high schools are almost twice as likely as students in the wealthiest schools to have no access to counseling. In fact, 8.4 percent of high-poverty high schools lack a guidance counselor at all. And while the disparities in access to counseling are not as stark — 7.4 percent of low-poverty schools lack counselors too — the need in high-poverty schools is arguably much greater. Lower-income students are much more likely to be first-time college-goers and to need more help with academic guidance financial aid.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*WTsBVC4PBIvhIN-W.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><em>Source: The Pell Institute</em></p>\n<p>It’s of course no surprise that high-poverty schools lack resources more generally, but the CLASP <a href='http://www.clasp.org/resources-and-publications/publication-1/CollegeReadinessPaperFINALJune.pdf' title='' rel=''>report</a> is valuable in several respects. First, it pinpoints a specific set of priorities for policymakers to target scarce funding for the greatest impact. As painful as it is to forego needed infrastructure upgrades or other improvements, school administrators now know that coursework and counseling must come first</p>\n<p>The report also takes a valuable step in quantifying the disparities between high-poverty and more affluent schools — and thereby also offering some objective guideposts for what equal opportunity in education should look like. All schools should offer Algebra II, for example, and school districts can track their progress toward educational parity through this measure. Districts can also ensure that schools have a similar mix of novice versus seasoned teachers.</p>\n<p>Educational inequality is without doubt a multi-faceted problem. But this report offers a glimmer of hope that the challenge is measurable — and thereby solvable.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published at <a href='http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/republic3-0/2015/07/how_to_fix_high_poverty_high_s056419.php' title='' rel=''>www.washingtonmonthly.com</a>.</em></p>	2015-07-14 19:48:56.427414	2015-07-20 19:01:28.799349	<h3>How to Fix High Poverty High Schools</h3>\n<p>Affluent high schools have three things lower-income schools lack, says a new study.</p>
61	6	The One Thing No New Teacher Has to Worry About	You’ve completed your requirements and graduated from some faculty of education. You spent some time in a class as an “assistant” teacher…	2015-07-05 00:12:25	17fd53b1ac5b	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*UZE013YugU30QSzSyzhJTQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">photo cred: www.ecosmartworld.com</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>You’ve completed your requirements and graduated from some faculty of education. You spent some time in a class as an “assistant” teacher, instructing students, who are not your own, under the watchful gaze of the “real” teacher who sat off in the corner. You’ve prepared lesson plans, units, and a collection of classroom management strategies that you are all too ready to try out when you step in the field for real. You are certified and ready to go. You are a new teacher. But, I know the truth. You are scared to death.</p>\n<p>I know this to be true because four years ago, I was in your exact same position. I had jumped through all the necessary loops and after receiving that phone call from my future principal saying that I was hired, I had never been more excited. That excitement carried me to my school that summer. I met my principal and he gave me the lay of the land with the final destination being my classroom. When we finally reached there he said, “Here are your classroom keys, set it up how you want and I will see you on the first day of school.” With that statement, I entered the deep waters of teaching on my own and without a safety jacket. Honestly speaking, that excitement of realizing that I had finally earned myself a career vanquished and was replaced with a humbling fear.</p>\n<p>This was no longer a test. When you get your first job as a teacher, it is the real thing. When September rolls around, you are for all purposes, on your own, responsible for the nurturing and educational guidance of young minds. The mark you leave seems indelible. It is a scary experience. But there is one thing that you will never have to worry about as a new teacher. And that is establishing yourself to your students as a “teacher”.</p>\n<p>Our traditional educational system, despite its many shortcomings, has safeguarded many elements essential to teaching. The most important is that “a teacher is a teacher”. The nights leading up to my first day of school, I had “teacher dreams” of walking into my classroom and my students calling me “Matthew”. I thought I would have to scratch and claw my road to authority over them. But unbeknownst to me, was the systemic value that all students intrinsically hold for teachers.</p>\n<p>Your identity will be formed as you grow into the profession. But lose no sleep over wondering if students will consider you a “real” teacher or not, because once you are in front of your own class, you <em>are</em> their real teacher. Negotiating over students about your authority as a teacher is the one thing you can thank the system for. Schooling has programmed students to respect (and unfortunately depend on) the adults in front of them to guide them. So for those brand new teachers who are worried about how they will be taken up in the classroom by their students, my advice: don’t worry, it will be automatic</p>\n<p>Original article found <a href='http://www.matthewrmorris.com/classroom/one-thing-no-new-teacher-worry/' title='' rel=''>here</a></p>	2015-07-14 19:48:57.831598	2015-07-20 17:01:33.757279	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*UZE013YugU30QSzSyzhJTQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>You’ve completed your requirements and graduated from some faculty of education.

65	6	Education’s “pea in the mattresses”	A tale of layers and royal domains	2015-07-02 00:06:04	f2e9f8a764af	<h2>Education’s “pea in the mattresses”</h2>\n<h3>A tale of layers and royal domains</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>by Brad C. Phillips, <a href='http://www.iebcnow.org/' title='' rel=''>Institute for Evidenced-Based Change (IEBC)</a> President and John Yopp, Director of Strategic Partnerships, <a href='http://www.luminafoundation.org/dqp-and-tuning' title='' rel=''>Tuning USA</em></a></p>\n<p>Sometimes the most obvious education solutions are the hardest to get attention for, much less implement.</p>\n<p>That’s the way it is with advocating for <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-c-phillips/a-college-completion-idea_b_6234172.html' title='' rel=''>K-12 and higher education working together</a> to improve college completion. The simple act of K-12 and higher education faculty and administrators together reviewing student performance data and observations about student needs delivers huge benefits. Student learning is made more relevant. The transition from K-12 to higher education is made smoother. Faculty understand more about what students need to succeed. More students earn degrees</p>\n<p>But this solution is a bit like the <a href='http://childhoodreading.com/?p=5' title='' rel=''>Hans Christian Andersen “Princess and the Pea”</a> tale with the pea that signals ‘happy ever after,’ stuck amidst layers and layers of separate K-12 and higher education cultures and control agencies. We’re still waiting for the most discerning would-be princess policymaker or philanthropist to discover this magical pea</p>\n<p>Like the prince, we’re stuck grumbling about the current state of affairs and princess candidates that just aren’t cutting it. The failure to link high school standards to post-secondary entrance expectations reverberates through a student’s life — and the nation’s economy.</p>\n<p><a href='http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/college_bound/2014/12/high_school_grads_unprepared_for_future.html' title='' rel=''>Two-thirds of high school graduates</a> said they would have taken higher-level courses in high school if they had realized the expectations of college and the working world</p>\n<p>According to an <a href='http://www.act.org/research/policymakers/cccr14/pdf/CCCR14-NationalReadinessRpt.pdf' title='' rel=''>ACT report</a>, only about 46 percent of 2014 graduates were considered college-ready</p>\n<p>Anywhere from <a href='http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/improving-college-completion-reforming-remedial.aspx' title='' rel=''>28 percent to 40 percent of students</a> require at least one remedial course. For community college students, remediation rates surpass 50 percent. This detour from college-level courses is costly in both time and money. It often means the end of college and with it prospects for advancement in career and life</p>\n<p>Reforms, such as the Common Core State Standards and the College Completion agenda, are underway at all levels. We’re getting closer. But the U.S. needs systemic reform that joins educators at all levels to pull in the same direction.</p>\n<p>Imagine all stakeholders — K-12 school staff and administrators, higher education faculty and leadership, workforce leaders, students, government, and accrediting agencies– <em>all </em>focused on one agenda that creates graduates who are prepared to succeed</p>\n<p>Tuning USA, which is now 6-years old and underway in several states, is a key part of the solution. Adapted for the American education system from its roots in Europe and funded by the Lumina foundation, Tuning has helped educators align 2- and 4-year post-secondary disciplinary pathways in selected fields. The non-profit <a href='http://www.iebcnow.org/' title='' rel=''>Institute for Evidenced-Based Change (IEBC)</a> facilitates the process engaging faculty experts in the selected disciplines to agree upon core learning outcomes and shared competencies that define and align associate, bachelor’s and master’s degree levels</p>\n<p>So why not tune further to create a signaling system that clearly communicates what is expected at each level of education?</p>\n<p>In essence, post-secondary education would be signaling to K-12 what high school students need to know, understand and be able to do.</p>\n<p>We know what greater collaboration can accomplish. In Southern California, high school teachers and college faculty members participating in the English Curriculum Alignment Project (ECAP) achieved<a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-c-phillips/a-college-completion-idea_b_6234172.html' title='' rel=''> transformational</a> results after addressing gaps between what was taught in high school English and what was expected in college English. High school teachers were mostly teaching literature, focusing on characters and story lines in classic works of fiction. English instructors at the college level were focused on teaching students about argumentation and writing clearly to inform, persuade and describe — key skills needed to succeed at work, think critically and contribute to the community</p>\n<p>Faculty and school leaders from community college and school districts who participated in the Texas Gulf Coast Partnership for Achieving Student Success (GC PASS) project created <a href='http://www.iebcnow.org/NewsAndPublications/NewsReleases/CommunityCollegesBigOpportunity_TexasGulfCoastRegi.aspx' title='' rel=''>curriculum alignment guides</a> to bridge K-12 and higher education math and English to help students successfully transition from high school through college degree completion. Partnerships like these are the driving force behind finally clinching an education system that is more in touch with what students need, particularly the most underserved</p>\n<p>But the very idea that secondary and post-secondary education should work together has not yet taken root in the highly decentralized and royal domains for the U.S. education system.</p>\n<p>When and if education decision makers discover this elusive solution, the “happy ever after” will be sweet. Faculty at K-12 and post-secondary levels will work together and align what is taught to improve student success in college and beyond. The need for remedial education could be significantly reduced, shortening the time needed to obtain a degree and making college more affordable students and their families. Employers will get more of what they need from graduates. That’s a pea worth discovering!</p>\n<h4>*See other columns in <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-c-phillips/' title='' rel=''>Huffington Post</a></h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*oPo7w8Hkx_AFhkT_UpKT3A.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Brad C.

Six white women (some say five) decided that a young Black man was responsible for his own murder, and they believed that a young Black woman could not be a credible witness. Where is your (OUT)RAGE?! Where is *your* intersectional analysis about white privilege, that not only calls out the operations of racism, but the particularly gendered operations of racism in the hands of these white women jurors? Where is the accountability? Where is the allyship? Why AGAIN do we have to ask you to show up? It is time for y’all to do the work. We refuse. We are tired. We are choosing to take care of ourselves and our communities. “</>\n<></>\n<p>I took these words personally because these words <em>are </em>personal. They are directed at me and they fill me with shame. So I am trying to not be silent. With all the talk this summer about what it means to be a young black male in America, I thought I would write about what it means to be a young white male in America. I’m going to tell you a story about my son and being white in America when it’s dark outside. It isn’t much, I know, but it’s what I have right now</p>\n<p>My husband and I are both originally from the Northeast (New York and Pennsylvania, respectively) but we currently live in North Carolina, due to the somewhat bizarre and unforgiving nature of the academic job market. Don’t get me wrong, I have actually come to love many things about my new Southern home: the heat, the complete absence of winter, the way people wait and hold the door open for you, even when you are a good fifty paces behind them. I even like being called “ma’am.” But there are drawbacks to our Southern location. Obviously, North Carolina’s stance on marriage equality, abortion, voter rights, religious freedom, etc.. etc. is garbage. But that’s a different post all together. The other problem with living here is, of course, that my husband and I are 400–600 miles away from our families. This means that we travel a lot, especially in the summertime. This is a story about one of those trips.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago my husband and I packed up our minivan and our kids and headed for central Pennsylvania. We take I-95 North, a highway which always seems to be plagued with construction, traffic delays and accidents, which means that a trip that should take 6 hours often takes 8 hours. To avoid these delays, we usually try to drive during off-peak hours, leaving around 6pm and arriving around midnight. On this particular trip, my husband and I were delighted to be getting off the D.C. beltway, onto 270, around 10pm. That meant we would reach our beds by 11:30pm. We were in the midst of high-fiving each other when our 3-year-old son, who only speaks in capslock, announced “I GOTTA MAKE POOPY.” Our faces fell. 270 exists to get people on to and off of the beltway, not for potty breaks. All of the nearby exits led to gated communities and medical parks. There would be no easily accessibly bathrooms for many miles.</p>\n<p>“Hey buddy, can you try to hold it for a little bit?” my husband asked. “SURE” yelled our son. But ten minutes later he bellowed “I CAN’T TAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS,” a turn of phrase he has recently learned and which he tries to use whenever possible. We sighed and took the next exit, knowing that locating a bathroom at 10 pm in the Maryland suburbs was going to be a challenge. We drove for miles and miles, seeing nothing. “I NEED TO GO POOPY” the 3-year-old periodically reminded us. “I know, honey, we’re trying.” Finally, after 15 minutes of frantic searching, we spotted a group of men playing baseball in front of what appeared to be a recreational center. I suggested we check it out, reasoning that these men would probably need a bathroom break at some point during their game. But as we drove through the complex we could find nothing. “Not even a port-a-potty?” I lamented. “I WILL GO IN THE PORT-A-POTTY” said the 3-year-old. “I know buddy. There’s no port-a-potty.”</p>\n<p>As we were about to turn around and leave, our goal of reaching bed by midnight now a distant memory, I saw a woman sitting in an SUV, talking on her cell phone. “Wait! Look over there! I’ll bet that woman can tell us where a bathroom is!” My husband stopped the minivan and I grabbed my son and headed over.</p>\n<p>At this point, I should probably tell you a little bit about my son. My son is adorable: he has big blue eyes, curly brown hair, and a big friendly smile. People go apeshit for my son. They stop me in grocery stores and on the streets to comment on his appearance: “Look at those curls! Look at those baby blues!” It happens so often, in fact, that it embarrasses me. I don’t say that to brag, because I have nothing to do with his good looks (he looks nothing like me). And he has nothing to do with his good looks either. He was just born that way. He’s lucky.</p>\n<p>So it’s 10 pm on a Thursday night in a Maryland suburb and my very cute son and I approach the woman in the SUV. “Excuse me?” I say, tentatively, because she is on her phone “We’re looking for a bathroom?” The woman raises a finger, indicating that she heard me, and says good-bye to whomever was the on the other line. “I’m sorry to bother you. It’s just that my son really needs to use the bathroom and we’ve been driving around…” “Come with me” she says, leading us to an alley behind the rec center. It is only now that I see that this woman is wearing a blue custodial uniform and a name tag. She works in the rec center and she is going to use her key to let us in. “What good fortune!” I thought to myself.</p>\n<p>The alley is dark and garbage cans line the brick walls. “I JUST NEED A PORT-A-POTTY!” the 3-year-old offers. “It’s okay,” I tell him, “the nice lady is taking us to the potty.” We finally enter the building and I immediately see a sign for the women’s locker room. “Thank you so much!” I tell the custodian, as I head inside. “Oh no!” she says, shaking her head, “You don’t go in there. It’s DIRTY,” she explains. I look again at the locker room and see that this is where the rec center staff probably goes to change and shower. “You follow me,” she says, and leads us down a series of hallways, until we reach another set of bathrooms. “See?” she says, “Clean.” I nod and head inside “Thank you SO much!” I repeat. I’m starting to feel a little guilty now, this is getting to be a lot of trouble for her.</p>\n<p>When we emerge from the bathroom 10 minutes later I am surprised to see that the custodian has waited for us at the end of the hall. But of course she had to wait — she let us in with her key, we were now her responsibility. We follow her out of the rec center, and I repeat my thanks. “You feel better now?” she says to my son, smiling, placing her finger tips to his. “Such pretty hair,” she adds. “THANK YOU” my son replies, in capslock. And then we get back into our minivan. “People are so nice,” I tell my husband, as I buckle the 3-year-old into his carseat. “That woman probably wanted nothing more than to go home and take a shower and go to bed, but instead she spent 20 minutes helping a stranger and her son get to a bathroom.” My husband nods in agreement.</p>\n<p>As our roadtrip resumed, I continued to think about this encounter and the kindness of strangers. But then i thought about something else. I thought about how this scenario would have played out if I had <em>not </em>been a white woman with a blue-eyed son, emerging from a minivan. You see, this incident happened just 5 days after George Zimmerman’s acquittal, in which jurors decided that being young and not-white and male is inherently threatening, that being all of these things meant that Zimmerman had a <em>right </em>to feel threatened and to “stand his ground.” Indeed, if I had I been a young, African American father whose 3-year-old son needed to use the potty at 10pm in some Maryland suburb, I would have had to think twice before approaching this woman in the parking lot. I would have needed to be careful not “scare” her. I would have needed to demonstrate to her that I was not a threat. And then, maybe, <em>maybe</em>, my son could use those nice clean bathrooms in the rec center</p>\n<p>But of course, I didn’t need to worry about any of that at 10 pm on a Thursday night in the Maryland suburbs. When I approached that woman in her car, I did so without considering my skin color or my son’s skin color. I rarely need to consider my skin color. All I needed to do is was be white and the world curved itself around my needs. And this is how things are going to be for the rest of my son’s life. He is white, he is male, and he comes from an upper-middle class home. The world is open to him — all he needs to do is decide what he wants. I’m not saying that he won’t have struggles. His life will be hard at times, in the way all peoples’ lives are hard at times. But he will be playing life at its <a href='http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/' title='' rel=''>“lowest difficulty setting”</a> and, really, good for him. He’s lucky</p>\n<p>The same is basically true for my 7-year-old daughter, though of course, she will have to fight a few battles that my son won’t, just because she’s a woman. For example, when she goes to a pizza parlor to pick up a tray of manicotti, the men who work there will offer to carry it for her, and even after she tells them, <em>twice</em>, that it really isn’t heavy and she can manage it just fine, thank you very much, they will take it anyway and start carrying it to the door until she says, a little too loudly, “REALLY. IT’S FINE. PLEASE GIVE IT TO ME.” And then they’ll hand her the manicotti and wonder, silently, why some women can’t just accept a little help now and then. And she’ll carry the manicotti, which isn’t very heavy (<em>really) </em>out to her car and she’ll try not to be annoyed at those men because they were just doing what they’ve been trained to do, which is to help white women who seem like they can’t help themselves. She is a virtue that requires protection. But her life won’t be too hard, her difficulty setting being only a little higher than her brother’s</p>\n<p>I’m writing this because I know our world is filled with all sorts of kind people, like that custodian who looked at me and at my sweet boy and decided to help us out, even though she didn’t have to. For the most part, this is how I experience the world and those experiences show me that the world can be a kind place. But as my family and I made our way up 270, I couldn’t help but think of Trayvon Martin’s family, and how different the world must look to them.</p>\n<p>This post is a drop in the bucket. It’s an attempt to talk about being white, which is something white people don’t do very often. This post is me being not-silent.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published at <a href='http://judgmentalobserver.com/2013/08/03/a-true-story-about-being-white/' title='' rel=''>judgmentalobserver.com</a> on August 3, 2013.</em></p>	2015-07-14 19:49:05.728444	2015-07-20 01:01:39.728724	<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/800/0*D_hj83LJTjynrx9s.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>After the ruling in the Zimmerman case I read a post by the <a href='http://www.crunkfeministcollective.com/' title='' rel=''>Crunk Feminist Collective</a> in which they asked</p>\n<>“Calling all white feminists…</>

In it, a teacher and author of an advice book for teachers carefully counsels any new teacher listening to “dress the part”. She goes on to mention how, as new teachers, you must “earn your stripes” so to speak, and that first year is a proving ground for your professionalism. While I do agree (to a certain extent) with this supplemental reasoning behind “dressing the part”, I take issue with that fact that one ought to <em>look </em>like a teacher</p>\n<p>How a teacher is supposed to look is the bigger question here. And more importantly, who gets to decide what the “norm” is? If you feel comfortable wearing a dress shirt and tie when you go out there and teach, by all means go right ahead. But there is also nothing wrong with wearing a pair of jeans and some Air Jordan’s to work in my opinion either. Remember, the things you teach students are not solely derived from the curriculum you deliver. Your presence in the classroom, and the way you dress also serves as a learning lesson to your students.</p>\n<p>Teaching requires an understanding that the school is a microcosm of the real world. And eventually your students are going to graduate and base their decisions (in terms of careers, etc.) off of what they explicitly and implicitly learned from the schools they went to. When a teacher walks into a classroom wearing a t-shirt and jeans, they are re-establishing our current notions of professionalism. In many urban areas, part of the reason why there is such a disconnect between students and teachers is due to the perceptual difference. Students sometimes disengage with schooling because the teachers they are learning from sound <em>and look </em>nothing like them. I am not suggesting that all teachers go out and dress like teenagers. Far from it. I am saying, be comfortable with what you wear to school because “dressing the part” also ties into a systemic realism created from those in privileged positions</p>\n<p>A teacher’s goal is to open possibilities for students. Part of an opening of possibility can be created when teachers break down the current and limited views of success and “professionalism”. Validating voices, appearances, and bodies that have been on the margins by society will be more easily achieved when we open up the idea of professional attire and trouble our current stereotypes. There are certainly things that a teacher should never wear to work (belly tops, ripped jeans, etc.). But there is no definite model that all teachers should adhere to. So when you tell a new teacher to dress the part, be mindful of what you are insinuating and what you are saying about particular cultures.</p>\n<p><em>Original article found at <a href='http://www.matthewrmorris.com/teaching/advice-new-teachers-dress-part/' title='' rel=''>matthewmorris.com</a>.</em></p>	2015-07-14 19:48:55.091412	2015-07-20 21:01:03.996041	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*m67aeOrSMgWpClDm_v8esw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I recently read a blog on advice for new teachers from veteran teachers.

Instead of simply powering up over the summer, let’s concentrate on a few things we can do to <em>empower up</em> this summer</p>\n<p><a href='https://medium.com/@tim_monreal' title='' rel=''>By: Tim Monreal</a></p>\n<><a href='https://pixabay.com/en/power-utility-pole-electricity-731824/' title='' rel=''>Image Source: User SnapwireSnaps, Pixabay.com</a></>\n<p>Summer brings an unexplainable happiness and joy to most teachers, myself included. Teachers are extremely fortunate to get a period of rest, respite, and reflection each year. I would go so far to say all professions should have a ‘break’ like this. Extended time away balances one out and prevents us all from working our lives away. A long summer recharges the batteries and provides an opportunity to start the school year ready to rock and roll.</p>\n<p>There is a common misconception that a teacher’s job ‘stops’ over the summer. I don’t think so. The job merely shifts. Most educators attend conferences, read books, prepare lesson plans, and game plan for a successful year. Thus, summer is important for many reasons. Summer is more than a time to recharge, its a time to regenerate, rejuvenate, and to improve.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/800/1*4ufPu1PWu_SfhN6oA9dGag.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Image Source: User Stevebidmead, Pixabay.com</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I have a challenge for my fellow educators this summer. Instead of simply powering up over the summer, let’s concentrate on a few things we can do to <em>empower up</em> this summer. What can we do over the summer to empower ourselves as professionals, leaders, and change agents for the coming year? How can we prepare ourselves to look beyond the trivial day-to-day skirmishes over recess duties, attendance procedures, email norms, and copier limits</p>\n<p>How can we empower ourselves to lead difficult discussions on technology, curriculum, inequality, and society? I don’t have the answer, but I think we can start with an attitude shift. Accepting the challenge to start the school year as an empowered leader will guide the preparation we take on. Maybe the books we read will be different. Maybe the summer travel destinations will change. Maybe the conversations we engage will be different. Maybe we will approach summer profession development in a new way.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/800/1*G-eH2nd-liTsOXKMH06AzQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Image Source: User Space-X Imagery, Pixabay.com</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I understand empowerment looks different to each teacher. It should. The underlying reason for approaching the summer with an empowerment focus is because teachers are models. Models in the sense that students, and other teachers, look to our attitudes and behaviors. We model the actions and perspectives of those who look to us. If we want our students to be empowered, then we need to authentically feel so ourselves. If we want other teachers to be leaders, then we need to be willing to lead. Teachers also need to exhibit their professionalism, their prestige, their importance. Many of us have advanced degrees and years of experience. We are professionals. Starting next school year, I challenge you to show others your power and <em>empowerment</em>. It starts now</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you enjoyed this post please click the recommend button below and share it on social media.

13	3	Channeling Our Efforts as Educators	From the Field	2015-05-04 20:53:24	ce9313ec8aee	<h4><em>From the Field</em></h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*R4RUjez-pe7E553jlCIQMQ.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>As we are challenged with thinking about math in a different way than many of us learned, it’s helpful to stop and think about how we are spending our time and channeling our efforts. I share with you an interaction that I had with an educator at a recent professional development event.</p>\n<p>We just finished watching a video of the “Concept Development” and “Debrief” of a 3rd grade lesson and were discussing the “aha’s” that we had gained from watching the video. The teacher raised her hand and shared her “aha” moment, “There was no SMART Board,” she said, “there was no SMART Board in the classroom, and the kids still learned!”</p>\n<p>The classroom in the video was equipped with a simple white board that the teacher and students were utilizing to work out example problems. The kids were actively engaged in their learning; they were discussing the math, participating in the activities, and smiling.</p>\n<p>This was a pivotal moment for that educator. “I’ve been spending hours each night preparing lessons so that they look pretty,” she said, “imagine if I spent all of that time learning the math and preparing for the lesson instead of wasting time creating something flashy.

Books provide everything — reference, information, fun, escape, challenge and inspiration. They light fires and calm storms. Food for the brain, they fill every room in my house and I honestly believe that their presence has encouraged and educated my kids, at times as if by osmosis. A strategically placed book (the bathroom is good) can reap wonderful benefits. My kids have consumed encyclopedias found in the bathroom. Whatever works. Magazines and newspapers are invaluable, too.</p>\n<p>My four kids are all very different readers — from the boy who read the <em>Harry Potter</em> series six times to the lad who doesn’t read novels, but will spend hours poring over design magazines and manuals. Another son reads music theory and science literature, and my daughter is reading <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> again (and again). “Harper’s” Index is popular, as is their Findings column. Cooking magazines get a fair amount of attention, as do comics. There are, however, a handful of books that I consider the foundation of all reading and learning in our homeschool. This is my quirky list of the literature that helps me feel good about this experiment of ours. After all, it’s all a lab</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. A Little History of the World</h3>\n<h4>by E. H. Gombrich</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*8GTaqPCRqEftOLJOg1IlSA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Written in 1935, this book is a delight. Deceptively simple and accessible, it’s also fascinating and educational. I read this to young kids and enjoyed it myself. Gombrich’s style is friendly and reels in the reader with excellent hooks. He drops us into time and place effectively, allowing imagination free rein. I have yet to find a history text for students that can make a similar claim. History buffs may find things to quarrel with, but I think this is a stellar first look for young people. I have referenced it time and again — the mark of a keeper.</p>\n<h3>2. Archimedes and the Door of Science</h3>\n<h4>by Jeanne Bendick</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*xi3CL0oXRZ2tJVMjUIlqXA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This little book, well-written and with many helpful illustrations, was an excellent introduction to science, math, and ancient Greece for all of my children. And they all loved it — a great endorsement. Read and re-read, referenced frequently, it opened doors in my own math-averse brain and emboldened us to dive deeper. The illustrations are simple, but support the text beautifully.</p>\n<h3>3. The Cartoon History of the Universe</h3>\n<h4>by Larry Gonick</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*zg_nNVo8zab_v6pdJ4IuHw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This is a series of books presenting history in comic form. It is, by turns, hilarious and informative and, I am sure, infuriating to some serious history types. I will say that I have at least one friend who is appalled at the notion of teaching history in such a goofy way. We, however, have thoroughly enjoyed the rollicking, occasionally irreverent tone of these books — they make a great start to a love of learning, and of reading. We have to hook them, or we risk losing them to the dry, dull tone of so many history textbooks. This series provides a great launch pad for the exploration of what should be a thrilling subject. (A note: this series takes you up to the Renaissance and then you will want <em>The Cartoon History of the Modern World</em>, also by Gonick.</p>\n<h3>4. Harry Potter</h3>\n<h4>by J.K Rowling</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*IkR7qQPSoYUxRK2zmORg3A.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I know. Cliché, but I can’t help myself. This series has provided more fun reading hours for more of us, together and separately, than any other. To be honest, two of my four kids couldn’t care less about Harry, but the pleasure that the other two and I got out of it makes it a top ten. Intelligent and riveting, this series almost single-handedly made one of my sons a serious reader, and my daughter and I had so much fun reading it together that it was almost all we talked about for months. Most of my adult friends have read and loved them as well, so if you haven’t tried yet, maybe it’s time.</p>\n<h3>5. Calvin and Hobbes</h3>\n<h4>by Bill Watterson</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*0fcHyp3UsnZJVamUFVzfTg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>What to say about Calvin? Brilliant, hilarious, touching and humane, he has enlivened many hours in my house for all members of the family. Witty and urbane, silly and puerile — how did Watterson do it? We have roared with laughter and read strips aloud to one another and I’ve greatly appreciated the perfect little messages often embedded in these comics — be kind, take care of the planet, television is toxic, etc. They also go a long way toward improving vocabulary, as Calvin can be quite the little wordsmith. These collections are perhaps the most well-worn books in my house, and deservedly so. Don’t dismiss the comic form until you try it.</p>\n<h3>6. Ferdinand</h3>\n<h4>by Munro Leaf</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*FINtrFSVwT9RndJbjsPZhw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This 1936 classic is, to my mind, a perfect example of the best of children’s picture books. The story is so simple, so spare, and the illustrations so clean and expressive, that readers of any age are delighted. My babies loved the story of the bull, and my older kids still recall the tale with affection. My eleven-year-old has been referring back to it lately for a model of writing and illustrating children’s stories. Ferdinand is timeless and for that reason deserves a spot on our permanent shelf. I can’t wait to show it to grandkids. (Okay, I’m willing to wait, but you get the point).</p>\n<h3>7. The Hobbit</h3>\n<h4>by J.R.R. Tolkien, illustrated by Michael Hague</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*psz9Io16anBwDYfn7No4aw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This version of the ubiquitous classic is a treasure. It is the type of book that gets dragged to and from beds, outdoors, and into the car. The story of Bilbo is thrilling enough in Tolkien’s telling, but Hague’s illustrations make it sing. If you’re going to invest in any hardcover books, put this one on your list.</p>\n<h3>8. Eloise</h3>\n<h4>by Kay Thompson</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*zd2sQsPpW1ScJ_L06q4DCw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Eloise has provided many happy hours to all of us. The text is written in the voice of the mischievous, precocious titular character, so we get a child’s-eye view of the famous Plaza Hotel. Her made-up words, run-on sentences, and raucous joie-de-vivre are charming, hilarious, and touching. All of my children, and any nearby adults, have roared with laughter upon hearing Eloise’s take on life. As she would say, “it’s rawther fluzzery”. (Don’t miss <em>Eloise in Paris</em>, either.</p>\n<h3>9. His Dark Materials Trilogy</h3>\n<h4>by Philip Pullman</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*CdtS35od5nW3ERgadI3L-w.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>“Intense and amazing”, in the words of my eleven-year-old. And she has only read the first installment (<em>The Golden Compass- </em>don’t watch the movie). These books introduced some deep and difficult subject matter to the readers in my house and occasioned quite a lot of discussion. Religion, physics, astronomy, geography, politics — it’s all here. This series is intelligent and provocative and is another that begs re-reading. For those who want more, we also enjoyed <em>The Science of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials</em> by Mary and John Gribbin, and Pullman’s own <em>Lyra’s Oxford</em></p>\n<h3>10. Miss Rumphius</h3>\n<h4>by Barbara Cooney</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*H9yDABLlN_hwWlW3onNspA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This lovely book holds a special place in my heart and has been read many times to and by all of my children. A beautiful story that simply depicts the span of a life and the meaning therein, much of its power comes from the beautiful illustrations. Natural beauty and the power that each of us has to impact our world are the central themes — this is a book that speaks to young and old.</p>\n<p>This list is just the tip of the iceberg — a small collection of desert island books for the stranded homeschooling family. It was difficult to select so few — there are many more that have touched us in profound and lasting ways. Looking at the pile of them, though, I realize what a treasure this group represents.

71	7	Solving Word Problems Using Tape Diagrams (Part 2)	Aha! Moment	2015-07-15 17:28:46	137e88dc53bc	<h4>Aha! Moment</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a recent <a href='https://medium.com/eureka-math/solving-word-problems-using-tape-diagrams-3dd2daebccf7' title='' rel=''>blog post</a> we took a look at how tape diagrams help students move from a model to more efficient methods of multiplying and dividing with fractions. Let’s take this a step further and see how tape diagrams can be used to solve algebraic equations where students need to write or solve equations</p>\n<p>Students start to use tape diagrams as early as first grade. When it comes to sixth grade algebra and beyond, a tape diagram is a well-known tool that students may use with confidence.</p>\n<p>Check out the tape diagram in action with this seventh grade problem from Module 3, Lesson 9:</p>\n<><strong><em>Every day Heather practices soccer and piano. Each day she practices piano for 2 hours. If after 5 days she practiced both piano and soccer for a total of 20 hours, how many hours, h, per day did Heather practice soccer?</strong></em></>\n<p>Students are expected to write an equation to represent this situation, which can be a difficult task. However, the tape diagram can help provide a visual of the problem first.</p>\n<p>Start by representing the amount of time practicing both piano and soccer in one day. We know that Heather is practicing piano for 2 hours and soccer for <em>h</em> hours each day</p>\n\n<p>Now, we can show that Heather spends this same amount of time practicing on each of the five days. And we know that the total for all five days is 20 hours.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, students may be able to see the equation emerge. There are 5 copies of (<em>h</em> + 2) and the sum of all the pieces together is 20</p>\n\n<p>Or they could even add each piece together.</p>\n\n<p>Having students write the equation in different ways leads to a beautiful discussion on whether or not these equations really are the same, building even more mathematical understanding. This is, in fact, the <a href='https://medium.com/eureka-math/read-draw-write-a-better-strategy-for-solving-746300f5cdb8' title='' rel=''>RDW (Read, Draw, Write)</a> process at work: students are reading the word problem, drawing a model that represents the information given, and then writing an equation from that drawing</p>\n<p>Students often struggle going from word problem to equation. This model really helps students move from reading a problem and feeling lost to having a plan of action that will build the equation.</p>\n<p>Using tape diagrams early on in algebra will also help build the skills necessary for solving much more difficult problems later on. Consider this problem from Grade 9, Module 1, Lesson 25:</p>\n<><strong><em>16 years from now, Pia’s age will be twice her age 12 years ago. Find her present age.</strong></em></>\n<p>This problem can be quite difficult to set up at first. However, building a model can help students go from word problem to equation as they did in earlier grades.</p>\n<p>Start by representing Pia’s age right now.</p>\n\n<p>We can add to the diagram to show Pia’s age in 16 years.</p>\n\n<p>Now what about Pia’s age 12 years ago? We know that this piece will be smaller than<em> P</em>. The problem also states that in 16 years, Pia will be twice as old as she was 12 years ago. So we can divide the <em>P</em> + 16 piece in half to represent her age at <em>P - 12</em>. Showing that 2 copies of <em>P</em> - 12 is the same as\n<em>P</em> + 16</p>\n\n<p>Now students can use the model as a visual to write the equation that is needed.</p>\n<p>We can see that <em>P</em> + 16 is equal to 2(<em>P - </em>12), leading to the equation,\n<em>P</em> + 16 = 2(<em>P - </em>12). Students now have an equation and can use their algebra skills to solve for Pia’s current age</p>\n<p>Creating models for every problem can be very tedious. The true goal is to guide students to the most efficient method of solving, but students must understand how these equations are being developed before they will be able to write them on their own. The tape diagram is a great tool for building that understanding. Over time, students will have a better sense of how to form and solve equations from the word problems without having to draw models, but they will always have it as a tool to fall back on for more challenging problems.</p>\n<p><em>This post is by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/debbygrawn.eurekamath?fref=ts' title='' rel=''>Debby Grawn</a>, a </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a><em> writer for </em>A Story of Ratios (Grades 6–8)<em>.

Many times when we try to integrate technology into our teaching we get so focused on the shiny new thing that we forget that we are good teachers.</p>\n<p>It’s the end of June, I am at #ISTE2015 and there are a lot of shiny new gadgets to be tried. None of the new tools will improve teaching and learning by simply adding them to the classroom. There is no magic formula for teaching. Two of my favorite things about being a teacher are that every day there is something different and students will say and do crazy things. I can’t remember the last time I got to school and thought, “I can’t wait to use the new (insert new thing here).” I can remember, however, getting to school and thinking, “I can’t wait to see what the students do today.”</p>\n<p>I have spent a lot of time reading and scoring grants for Beaverton School District Positive Change Grants. Many of the grants were written in a way that made me think that the teachers forgot what good teaching looks like. Many of the grants focused on the fancy, shiny new technology. Many teachers conveyed the message that the technology will somehow make students smarter, more engaged in lessons, and more collaborative. There was not much focus on quality teaching and student learning.</p>\n<p>Is this what is best for the students? That is the question that I try to ask teachers every time we are making a decision that affects the classroom, school or district. When there is a fancy new technology tool teachers will do just about anything to integrate the fancy new gadget into their classroom. Teachers should be thinking, is (plug in the latest tool here) what is best for student learning before they try to force some new technology into their teaching. If a pencil is the best tool and is what will work best for your students, let them use a pencil.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/0*eC9soPcZ9EumLnLU.' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pencil_tip_closeup_2.JPG#/media/File:Pencil_tip_closeup_2.JPG</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>You are a good teacher.

Many educators and studies…	2015-07-23 02:29:27	d4a28ad47282	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*OZRaq9tODc5Hl-AWhmybIQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">photo cred: american.gallery.wordpress.com</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>For nearly a decade now, a pedagogical shift in education has occurred along the lines of teaching relevance. Many educators and studies contend that <a href='http://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/ptn/2013/09/students-relevance.aspx' title='' rel=''>relevance of course content</a> is the chief variable in creating engaged, motivated and self-regulated learners. As educators, we have all heard students gripe with sentiments similar to, “but, how am I going to use this in life?” only to rebut with some remark that either 1) demonstrates how they <em>may </em>use such content in the future, or 2) underlines that, “it is not about the content, it is about the <em>tools </em>that you are gaining by learning.” I personally don’t have a problem with either one and even use them from time to time. In fact, while I agree that the content we teach should have relevance, I feel that the entire pedagogical thinking behind the word “relevance” is utterly flawed</p>\n<p>In education, we tightly suture the term “relevance” with “relatedness” or “relateability”. And from this, we form a dichotomous logic that denounces any form of course content that is not relevant to students’ lived lives. We think that if a question, task, or project is not related to some aspect of our students’ lives then they will somehow be less engaged and won’t be grounded in their learning as much as if they had a task that was “relevant” to them. Sorry to say, this logic is flawed.</p>\n<p>You know what’s more relevant to kids? Checkers. A game that has no “real world” connection and no use, but kids love it. You know what else is relevant to kids (or at least the kids in my class the last few years)? Playing a game called “Bump” where four or five kids throw a tennis ball to each other and while they do that their feet must be in the air. They literally stand in a circle and catch and simultaneously toss a ball while jumping. If they have the ball in their hands while on the ground, they are “eliminated”. THAT is relevant to them. And do you know what is <em>most relevant </em>to<em> </em>kids? Success. Knowing something or being an expert at something is relevant to kids. Why do you think they play the same game or watch the same movie over and over again? Most kids play video games all day because there is some reward at the end; some new level or some prize, not because it is “relevant” to their lives</p>\n<p>My point is that educators/adults need to slow down when considering and implementing new policy that speaks about students without hearing <em>from </em>students. Most adults don’t know what’s cool or relevant to kids. They write these long-winded math questions about rock bands thinking that students will be more “engaged” when they read it. Most students couldn’t care less what the question is about. They only ask, “What am I going to use this for?” when they are struggling. They are struggling because the <em>way </em>we are teaching the content is wrong. We are teaching wrongly when we assume that bringing in some <em>relevant content</em> is a magic wand to student engagement</p>\n<p>When students understand something, it becomes engaging and relevant. Thus, teachers need to focus more on the structure of the lesson and not on the actual content of the lesson because teaching relevance is a myth. (That may be a stretch but at worst it’s misunderstood). The obsession over teaching relevance needs to stop because we don’t even have the right definition of relevance in the first place.</p>	2015-07-23 03:01:07.702937	2015-08-03 13:01:18.576402	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*OZRaq9tODc5Hl-AWhmybIQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>For nearly a decade now, a pedagogical shift in education has occurred along the lines of teaching relevance.

Towards the end of every June, the highways start to get slightly less condensed, the crossing guards go home, and those buildings that house hundreds of children throughout the fall, winter, and spring are empty and quiet. Summer break isn’t the chief reason why anyone would decide to do this job. But it is a pretty decent incentive. And now that we are here, there are a few vital things that every teacher <em>must </em>do during their summer break. Want to make it through the rigor of another ten months teaching children? Well, here are 5 things every teacher should do during summer break, in no particular order</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>1. Sleep</h4>\n<p>This one is a no-brainer. After ten months and most likely multiple colds, that first week of summer break is a great time to catch up on some missed rest. The first thing I do once summer break begins is shut off my morning alarm. And by sleep I don’t only mean sleep in. It takes a while to break that habit of waking up early, so if you’re still waking up at around 6:30 a.m., try taking a nap or two throughout the day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>2. Purge Your Classroom</h4>\n<p>When I first started teaching, I was given a classroom that was chock-full of resources, binders and a ton of other things. And while it was great that this teacher decided to leave me many things to help me through my first year, I realized by the end of the year that I hardly used any of it. And even with my own things, there is so much that I either never use or just print off when the time comes. Technology has changed things for teachers but it still seems as though we are trailing behind. Gone are the days of the stacks and stacks of photocopies. One USB saves a lot of space. Tidy up your classroom by getting rid of anything that can be uploaded and re-printed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>3. Un-Plug</h4>\n<p>This is similar to the piece I wrote on how to avoid teacher burn-out. For one or two weeks, whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of your summer break, it is imperative to take some time to do and think about things that are completely unrelated to school. Vacation time, exercise, or learning a new hobby are great ways to keep the mind off of contemplating what little thing you could do today to be more prepared for next year.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>4. Reflect on the Year</h4>\n<p>Reflection is key in helping you become a more polished teacher. Making a conscious effort to think about the things that worked well in class juxtaposed with the things that didn’t well help you narrate how to do better next year. Also, focus on things that caused stress and things that were most memorable. These insights can provide great clarity leading into a new year.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>5. One New Thing for Next Year</h4>\n<p>I know it is summer break and many teachers want to spend the time <em>trying</em> not to think about that first day or first week back. But most teachers inevitably contribute some aspect of their summer break to their professional development. Whether it is reading a book related to education, gathering a new resource, or coming up with an engaging lesson, activity, or assignment, you should take the time to create one new thing to add to your teacher’s tool belt over the summer. Last summer, I learned a new classroom management strategy (simply a phrase) from reading a blog that I thought I’d try with my class. By the last day in June, I was still using it to get my students’ attention</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Summer is the time for teachers to get the “Three R’s” in: rest, relax, and recover. But who are we kidding? All teachers feel the itch to do just a little something to prepare for next year. Find the balance between being productive and enjoying your well deserved vacation. The right balance will lead to a fulfilling summer break that will have you equipped to head back in once the break ends.</p>\n<p>For more, check out <a href='http://www.matthewrmorris.com' title='' rel=''>my blog</a></p>	2015-07-14 19:49:11.002722	2015-07-16 17:01:29.833439	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*KQR92I8kK8OKwg3Q3EJ29g.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>It is that time of year once again.

My mom, my aunt, my grandma, and now even both my brother and I, make our own…	2015-07-08 15:24:45	30caaa7372d6	<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/800/0*7Z4SF8zltCl4QaZ0.jpg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Spaghetti sauce has become a staple in my family’s culture. My mom, my aunt, my grandma, and now even both my brother and I, make our own, homemade spaghetti sauce. Sure, it’s a bit more work than buying a jar of Prego at the grocery store, but the time we’ve lost by investing ourselves into our sauces has compounded into a rich family culture, a culture from where I get a lot of my childhood memories.</p>\n<p>I always remember Mom’s two big pots of sauce, cooking for hours, filling the house with aromas of tangy tomato and smoked meatballs; I remember Grandma and Grandpa coming over to take care of my siblings and me, bringing fresh baked bread and Grandma’s version of spaghetti sauce–a bit lighter, but soaked with pieces of perfectly cooked ground beef. As I was making my own the other night, I reminisced on all that has come from a rather simple recipe, with rather simple ingredients, but has somehow evolved into these incredibly different versions of the same thing.</p>\n<p><strong>So what on earth does this have to do with teaching? Or with curriculum?</strong></p>\n<p><a href='http://paulemerich.com/2015/02/26/framing-learning-through-macro-and-micro-cycles/' title='' rel=''>Curriculum</a> has always been a hot topic. Companies and schools invest millions of dollars into copious amounts of resources, trying to find the best or the most comprehensive resource that will enable them to reach as many kids as possible. Over the years, these industries have become laden with <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/19/texas-textbooks-fails-approval_n_6185860.html' title='' rel=''>political initiatives</a>, under-the-table deals, and selfish motives simply to sell material, and every time, <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/23/national-curriculum-is-damaging-childrens-creative-writing-say-authors' title='' rel=''>we find that we’ve come up short</a>: we find that the material isn’t quite comprehensive enough, that it’s always going to be changed, and worse off, that the universal resource we <em>thought</em> we were making isn’t really universal at all. Instead, it’s one-size-fits-all, and that just isn’t going to cut it in the modern day classroom</p>\n<p>If we look at the underlying assumption here, it seems to me that what these companies are assuming is that one curriculum could meet the needs of all children. But what happens if we flip this assumption on its head? What happens when we assume that one curriculum will never meet the needs of all children? What if we, instead, assume that we need as many curricula as possible to meet the needs of all of our students?</p>\n<p>At first, this sounds like an impossible task. It sounds like, not only a larger financial investment, but a larger time investment. But I’m not entirely sure that’s the case.</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients and Recipes</strong></p>\n<p>I sat in a curriculum meeting the other day, and our school is attempting just this idea. Through our <a href='http://paulemerich.com/2015/06/25/what-spaghetti-sauce-has-taught-me-about-curriculum/www.altschool.com' title='' rel=''>network of microschools</a> and our <a href='https://www.altschool.com/meet-the-team#educators' title='' rel=''>network of educators</a>, we are trying to build a database of curriculum, one in which any teacher at any school in our system can find discrete skills, activities, and units, sourced from teacher-curated materials, as well as materials our system has been licensed to use</p>\n<p>“It’s like making a gumbo,” one of my colleagues mentioned. “I might look up a recipe for a roux when I make my gumbo, but what else I put in there depends on what I have in my fridge that day.”</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/800/0*zH0ePmSKU1zG6BWb.jpg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Mom’s “Spaghetti Mary Poppins,” spruced up with some new ingredients, thanks to my boo.</p>\n<p>He said this, sending me back in time, back years and years to my family’s spaghetti sauce recipes, but also back to the recent past. I visualized my boyfriend cooking–using his base knowledge of how certain contents mix together–to create new and unique dishes, each equally as delicious as the next. He rarely has a strict recipe that he follows; instead, he has lots of pieces of recipes that he knows, and he synthesizes them to create a new dish each time. Perhaps this is why he loves cooking so much; perhaps it’s the challenge, the rigor, and the uncertain outcome that keeps him guessing, wondering, and engaged in the art of cooking.</p>\n<p>And now that I think about more it, I think that’s what keeps me engaged in the never-ending cycle that is curriculum development.</p>\n<p><strong>Curricular Ingredients</strong></p>\n<p>Curriculum is no different than cooking. There are a fairly limited amount of subjects to teach, coupled with a few basic principles that apply to most, if not all, children. On top of that, we have a plethora of ingredients at our disposal, especially in the age of Internet-based education. Websites, online curricula like NewsELA, Khan Academy, and BrainPop!, and tech-based assessment tools provide us the opportunity to be artists–just like chefs in the kitchen–where we can mix, match, and mold our curriculum to meet the needs of a class full of learners, and even iterate for nuances in learning preferences on an individual level.</p>\n<p>This year, specifically, I was able to exercise this idea by teaching a unit on health and wellness. My goal was to teach the kids about healthy eating, appropriate portion size, and food in general, meanwhile incorporating lessons about fractions and measurement, personalized to various levels. Not only was this an incredibly real-world charge for my students, but it also required me to use the ingredients of good curriculum to make the richest and most robust experience possible. I included field trips to the grocery store, a snack budgeting project, and analyses of our own diets, meanwhile still finding time to give skill-building practice using tools like <a href='http://paulemerich.com/2015/06/25/what-spaghetti-sauce-has-taught-me-about-curriculum/www.khanacademy.org' title='' rel=''>Khan Academy</a> and <a href='http://paulemerich.com/2015/06/25/what-spaghetti-sauce-has-taught-me-about-curriculum/www.ixl.com' title='' rel=''>IXL</a></p>\n<p>This unit is now logged in our system, so at some point, other teachers can tap into the work already done. They can see the activities I’ve built and iterate on them for their own respective classes, tailoring each activity or sequence of activities appropriately and personalize as needed. In fact, when I think about this idea that my school has begun by making these units available to other teachers, I can’t help but think of my grandma–the originator of our spaghetti sauce culture, in all its glory. From this one recipe–and all of its ingredients–has come a diversity of recipes, all as delicious as the next, personalized to each individual chef and to his or her dinner guests.</p>\n<p><strong>Lessons on Large-Scale Curriculum</strong></p>\n<p>In short, curriculum–even the curriculum that we try to market large-scale–doesn’t have to be prescriptive, and it doesn’t have to be one-size-fits-all. Instead, the curriculum we try to market large-scale should promote artistry and an active inquiry into what really works for children. What’s more, it should aid teachers in personalizing materials by giving a foundation on which to stand, not a cage in which to sit, and it should contribute to a collective knowledge and understanding–an iterative and dynamic network of related curricula, that diversify with time and across generations.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published at <a href='http://paulemerich.com/2015/06/25/what-spaghetti-sauce-has-taught-me-about-curriculum/' title='' rel=''>paulemerich.com</a> on June 25, 2015.</em></p>	2015-07-14 19:48:55.891682	2015-07-20 23:01:07.20682	<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/800/0*7Z4SF8zltCl4QaZ0.jpg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Spaghetti sauce has become a staple in my family’s culture.

69	6	Let’s Use Medium to Teach Students How to Write	By Robinson Greig	2015-07-02 16:42:45	738f1116ce6	<p><em>By <a href='https://twitter.com/robinsongreig' title='' rel='nofollow'>Robinson Greig</a></em></p>\n<>Photo Credit: Death to the Stock Photo</>\n<p>I don’t need to start this article with <a href='http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/writing' title='' rel=''>an inspirational quote</a> that explains the importance of writing or with <a href='http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pubs/main2011/2012470.asp' title='' rel=''>an alarming statistic</a> about writing proficiency in the American education system</p>\n<p>We all get it. Writing allows us to reflect on who we have become, to effectively communicate about key issues, and to create and explore fictional worlds. The ability to write well offers value throughout life that one just can’t predict, which is why we need creative ways to not just teach students <em>how </em>to write, but to help students enjoy writing both in and out of the classroom</p>\n<p>I’m not an English teacher, nor am I qualified to be one. If I were though, I would use Medium to teach my students how to write. I’m going to give you three reasons why — the first is obvious, the second makes me most excited, and the last is the most important.</p>\n<>1 of 3</>\n<><em>Medium allows students to easily collaborate with teachers and peers.</em></>\n<><em>Photo Credit: Death to the Stock Photo</em></>\n<p>The writing process, especially in most writing classes, requires writing several drafts of the same piece before turning in that well-deserved final version. Medium allows writing students to send a draft link to anyone (even without a Medium account) before clicking that satisfying green publish button.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*eWFLboMtY7jhnMz7SBWmoA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Medium would allow students to easily share a draft and collect feedback from teachers and peers.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This means that students can easily collect feedback on an assignment from their teacher and student peers. Students can comment on their peers’ drafts by leaving short notes throughout the draft. The teacher can not only leave his/her own comments, but can also review and reply to the comments left by other students. This offers a much more collaborative learning experience for students (and Medium just looks way better than Google Docs).</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*mM0BACDiURGmspbcpwSE8Q.gif' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">The collaborative peer editing process would happen right in the assignment draft.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<>2 of 3</>\n<><em>Medium publications could be used to organize a local writing community.</em></>\n<><em>Photo Credit: Death to the Stock Photo</em></>\n<p>Publications on Medium have offered an incredible way for people to share their thoughts alongside related stories. There are publications about <a href='https://medium.com/bright' title='' rel=''>education</a>, <a href='https://medium.com/design-ux' title='' rel=''>design</a>, and <a href='https://medium.com/human-parts' title='' rel=''>humans</a>, but publications have not yet been widely used to organize a community of writers that share a physical space</p>\n<p>Example: <a href='https://medium.com/@Harvard' title='' rel=''>Harvard University</a> publishes articles on Medium, and there are articles published <a href='https://medium.com/tag/harvard-university' title='' rel=''><em>about </em>Harvard</a>, but there is no publication made open to the Harvard student body or to a single class within Harvard</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*v5vAFKhg9rtJTD-xh_OAsA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>A publication made open to a university student body could create a new kind of social network. Students could explore the latest stories written by their campus peers and could begin a discussion with the author either by commenting or meeting up for coffee. I could imagine such a community being used for any number of purposes:</p>\n<li>Students could write about key issues on campus, and the most recommended articles could lead to reform at the school.</li>\n<li>Students could share their ideas, research, and opinions. This could lead to developing a healthy entrepreneurial culture on campus.</li>\n<li>Prospective students could visit various college publications to get a very real taste of what that college is like vs. the next. This level of clarity in the college selection process is currently difficult to find.</li>\n<li>This list could go on and on…</li>\n<>3 of 3</>\n<><em>Medium would encourage students to publish.</em></>\n<><em>Photo Credit: Death to the Stock Photo</em></>\n<p>Perhaps my biggest critique of higher education (of all education, for that matter) is the sheltered approach to learning. Outside of some extracurricular activities and maybe an internship or two, students spend the bulk of their learning time in a classroom. Students stay in this safe environment for four years until they are released into “the real world.”</p>\n<p>I hate that expression. “the real world”</p>\n<p>The world that students live in while at university is no less real than the world they graduate to, so their learning experience should be treated as such: <strong>real</strong></p>\n<p>What if students were expected to publish their final drafts on Medium instead of turning them into their teacher? I suspect this would have a few effects on the writing learning experience:</p>\n<li>Grading in the arts has often been criticized for being mostly subject to the opinion of the grading teacher. By putting their work out to the Medium community for review, new methods for evaluating the quality of writing could be developed.</li>\n<li>If the grading responsibility were shifted away from the teacher, then students might feel greater freedom to write in their own style; their own voice, instead of trying to game the system by appealing to the teacher’s style.</li>\n<li>There really is no better feeling than having a community of people positively respond to and share one’s article. Exposing students to this experience could help them enjoy writing more.</li>\n<li>Last— and most important — if students were to publish their writing on Medium, <strong>they would be publishing their writing!</strong> I can not overstate how important that is! Students would be exposing themselves to the world and getting “real world” feedback on their work</li>\n<p>If there has been one piece of advice that I would point to that has helped me become a better writer, it’s this: <strong>“Just publish it!”</strong></p>\n<p>If you have enjoyed this article, please consider recommending it and sharing it with others.</p>	2015-07-14 19:49:10.275963	2015-07-19 21:01:43.604455	<h3>Let’s Use Medium to Teach Students How to Write</h3>\n<p><em>By <a href='https://twitter.com/robinsongreig' title='' rel='nofollow'>Robinson Greig</a></em></p>\n<p>I don’t need to start this article with <a href='http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/writing' title='' rel=''>an inspirational quote</a> that explains the importance of</p>

OK, it’s worse: The camera runs screaming in horror from anything resembling programming. Writing code might be the single least cinematic pursuit humankind has yet devised. It makes paint drying look like <em>Star Wars</em></p>\n<p>Hollywood has a hack for dealing with this: Never, ever show programming in any detail, particularly chunks of actual code, for more than a few seconds. <em>Step away from the keyboard. </em>Cut quickly to something sexier.\nSo why are thousands of software developers dallying for hours on a new website called <a href='http://livecoding.tv' title='' rel=''>Livecoding.tv</a> that lets them livestream their desktop coding dramas? They’re not, for the most part, seeking to entertain their viewers. (That’s good, given the odds.) The founders of the service say it’s all about education — and sure, there’s plenty of chances to learn stuff there. But what the developers on Livecoding.tv are really up to is something simpler: They’re transforming the solitary, frustrating act of coding into something more convivial. They’re making programming less lonely</p>\n<p>Today there are at least two schools of streaming style on Livecoding. There are the introverts, who sit in a dark room and mumble into their mikes or stay mum while they work their keyboards and mice. (Try Melbourne-based game developer “slateytv” for a <a href='https://www.livecoding.tv/video/ue4-tower-defence/' title='' rel=''>taste</a>.) The extroverts, by contrast, stream from busy rooms, talk a blue streak, and drag other people, along with the occasional pet, into the frame. Here, for instance, is <a href='https://www.livecoding.tv/video/rails-refactoring/' title='' rel=''>a rowdy late-night session</a> streamed from a Santa Cruz kitchen by Portland open-source developer “dogweather” (Robb Schecter), with beer and code both flowing</p>\n<p>On a trip around the site on a recent morning, I came across “famed,” or Dmitry Pavlov, a designer in Kharkiv, Ukraine, who is laboriously <a href='https://www.livecoding.tv/video/psd-to-html-4/' title='' rel=''>transforming</a> a static Photoshop mockup of an online store into Web-ready HTML/CSS. I don’t think Pavlov wants to be bothered much; he isn’t using a webcam, there’s no chat window, he’s not saying much, and the electronica soundtrack is turned up. He is streaming, it seems, simply as a way of declaring, “I exist.</p>\n<p>Over there, a student in Veracruz, Mexico who goes by “codehamster” is finishing up some homework. Again, for the drop-in visitor, there’s not much of a way in. Homework is being done! For codehamster, it’s the 2015 version of working in the university library instead of your room — just a way to share the presence of other souls.</p>\n<p>Ah! Here’s a livelier stream: A website builder in Maryland named Elijah Offutt is working on a personal portfolio site. He’s pouring himself some coffee and, as people turn up in his chatroom, he greets regulars by voice. “This is not my focus music,” he declares, and flips the soundtrack from pop to gospel, as he explains the workings of a skills matrix he’s devised, which gives clients and recruiters an instant read on whether he’d be a good fit for a project.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*n5DZPSzxQ5xYnJbq8wcQDA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Garbade and Green, Livecoding.tv founders, after their YC Demo Day presentation, August 19, 2015. Photo: Steven Levy</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Livecoding.tv opened its doors last winter. It started as a side project by two entrepreneurs, Jamie Green and Michael Garbade, who met in Berlin. They got more serious last December after receiving a seed grant from the European Union, opened a public beta in February, then won entry to the Y Combinator startup accelerator’s summer class. Today they’ve topped 60,000 registered users, and they’re seeing an average of 400 streams a day, or 700 hours of video — not much by, say, YouTube standards, but pretty good for a startup baby.</p>\n<p>“When we started,” Green says, “everybody we spoke to said it would be really hard to attract developers to use our platform. Developers are obviously very well-paid. There’s not much unemployment. They’re very busy. Everyone we spoke to said this is going to be a problem — they’re not going to have time to do this, or they’ll want to be paid lots of money. But it turns out that developers do have lots of time, and they want to spend it sharing what they’re working on.”</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*YnQeHnEY9gwckluV231TOg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Green and Garbade didn’t exactly invent the genre of programming <em>verité</em>. Around the same time that they were hatching Livecoding, Twitch.tv — the massively popular site where legions of gamers stream their play for the diversion of exponentially larger legions — <a href='http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/29/7113023/twitch-adds-category-for-building-games' title='' rel=''>opened</a> a <a href='http://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Game%20Development' title='' rel=''>category</a> for game development where programmers could share their work. Some of Livecoding’s more popular streamers, like “<a href='https://www.livecoding.tv/whilke/' title='' rel=''>whilke</a>,” are Twitch regulars who have brought some of their community over with them, along with some Twitch customs (like raffles); others, like “<a href='https://www.livecoding.tv/jegas/' title='' rel=''>jegas</a>” (Jason Sage), who currently tops the Livecoding <a href='https://www.livecoding.tv/statistics/streamers/' title='' rel=''>leaderboard</a>, make Livecoding their primary platform, taking advantage of the opportunity to make a name for themselves in its relatively uncluttered social environment. For Sage, as for other stars on Livecoding, that success today might mean 30 people tuned in to a live stream, and hundreds or thousands of views on an archived video</p>\n<p>I asked Sage, a motor-mouthed 30-year programming veteran who also fronts a heavy metal band, why he prefers Livecoding to Twitch. “With Twitch,” he said, “you end up with a whole bunch of gamer people, and, frankly, a whole bunch of trolls. On Livecoding, you get people who are into the programming — not necessarily brainiacs, but people that are really into code. Which makes it a lot easier to converse and joke. Everybody’s into it because they actually like it, not because they’re just there to see if you’re any good, and pick, and be annoying.”</p>\n<p>Unlike Twitch, Livecoding automatically archives every stream, which means that it’s quickly accumulating an extensive video library — although, right now, it’s not terribly well organized. (The clips don’t even carry dates.) The strategy exemplifies a phenomenon that <a href='http://kottke.org/07/03/public-and-permanent' title='' rel=''>blogger Jason Kottke identified</a> a decade ago as the key to so many successful web enterprises: Livecoding — like Blogger, Flickr, YouTube, Twitter and so many other services that eventually climbed the proverbial hockey-stick curve, most recently Twitch itself — “takes something that everyone does with their friends and makes it public and permanent.</p>\n<p>In that regard, Livecoding is nothing terribly new, and its fate will depend on the usual factors: Can it keep users happy and contributing? Can it keep bringing in high-profile users like Stephen Wolfram, who spent a couple of hours recently on the site providing a <a href='https://www.livecoding.tv/stephen_wolfram/' title='' rel=''>live tour</a> of his Wolfram Language? Can its founders win the hearts of investors, as they aim to do today at Y Combinator’s Demo Day? Can they figure out a way to make money? (They recently posted <a href='http://blog.livecoding.tv/2015/08/13/hire-a-streamer-for-private-11-or-group-sessions-request-a-stream-and-pay/' title='' rel=''>plans</a> to let people hire and pay streamers for 1:1 or group sessions on “advanced topics, code reviews, bug fixing, platform architecture, school homework, college coursework, or support building a product.”</p>\n<p>But there’s another way in which Livecoding really is different and notable: It’s an unexpected and potentially game-changing mutation in the DNA of the programming field itself.</p>\n<p>There is no trait more firmly associated in the public mind with the profession of software developer than “anti-social.” Programmers are loners; they fly from human contact. As with most stereotypes, this one has a foundation in fact. But there’s also a long arc in the history of programming that you might call “pro-social” — a determined and increasingly urgent move toward sharing among programmers. If we’re going to get better at making software, the thinking goes, we have to get better at capturing and communicating how we make it. We have to learn how to pry the act of coding out of the realm of pure abstraction and make it more legible and tangible, no matter how difficult that is, or how boring it looks.</p>\n<p>This was the idea behind Donald Knuth’s concept of “<a href='http://www.literateprogramming.com/' title='' rel=''>literate programming</a>,” which encouraged coders to write for other programmers first and the machine second. It was the motivation behind the explosion of both software-development forums and blogging in the early 2000s, giving voice to a field that had previously labored in obscurity. It lies behind the growing popularity of pair programming, which transforms software development from a solitary pursuit into a collaborative enterprise. In this context, Livecoding looks less like some sort of bizarrely self-indulgent reality-TV parody of software development, and more like a natural next step toward both optimizing and humanizing the work of programming</p>\n<p>But wait a minute: Isn’t the whole notion of “look at me” programming, um, distracting? Maybe. “I could do this stuff so much faster if I wasn’t casting,” Sage confessed to his webcam one day. “But I like hanging out with you guys. I like talking and yakking. I like it when I can help people out. That’s good stuff!”</p>\n<p>Sage, who wears a T-shirt that reads “shred neck,” likes to grab a guitar and solo (sometimes heavy-metal leads, sometimes classical) for 5, 10, sometimes 20 minutes at a time in the middle of his streams. The musical interludes don’t seem to have cramped his popularity on Livecoding. “They ask me for it!” he says. “Then half the room will leave. They’re like, fuck that. And the other half of the room is going, yeah! yeah! yeah! And then after that, they want to go back to coding.”</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*fdColoxm8DksBGtX7PScFA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Livecoding founder Green admits that streaming “isn’t for everybody,” but says there’s a class of users who find — pace Sage — that it actually makes them work more efficiently. “It keeps them focused. They know that people are watching, so they’re not going to be messing around with Facebook and wasting time. And those people might even be able to help! You know, they see, you made a mistake on this piece of code you just wrote, watch out there.”</p>\n<p>Whether you’re watching a lone wolf or a party animal, you’re going to encounter a whole lot of yawning, throat-clearing and snack consumption. Much of what’s on display at Livecoding is the tedious work of update downloading, patch installation and environment-tweaking. For instance, <a href='https://www.livecoding.tv/video/oddshottv-front-end-35/' title='' rel=''>watch</a> “donmildreone” (British web designer Ben Mildren) as he tries to get up and running on a new Mac. On the one hand: Really? On the other: For better or worse, this is what most programmers spend much of their time doing</p>\n<p>There’s no guarantee that Livecoding won’t turn out to be an ephemeral craze, a digital-era flash in the pan like CD-ROMs or “All your base.” You can just hear the mock-nostalgia: “Remember back in 2015, when they thought it was fun to stream coding sessions?”</p>\n<p>More likely, the site’s success is a sign that the play-everything-out-in-public dynamic of the Internet is going to keep invading new social spaces and injecting them with its thrills and worries — all that camaraderie, all that surveillance. Whatever Livecoding’s future, just think of what an incredible, massive trove of data it’s assembling. Some coding anthropologist has got one hell of a binge-view queued up.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*QXPFTt0jOZKk4eEiVci9cA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>	2015-08-28 03:00:37.579545	2015-09-23 15:00:43.105568	<h2>The Strange Appeal of Watching Coders Code</h2>\n<h4>Legions of programmers now stream their work on Livecoding.tv, a site that turns their lonely labor into something more…</h4>

One year, about a month before the state test was to be administered, I gave my students one sheet of word problems from the released test…	2015-09-16 13:34:26	3f965393c120	<p>One year, about a month before the state test was to be administered, I gave my students one sheet of word problems from the released test items so that they could practice. One student, let’s call him Isaac, raised his hand. When I approached him he said, “Mrs. Hassan, there’s a mistake on this problem.” I quickly scanned the problem about currency conversions and asked him to explain the error he found. His response, “There are too many numbers. When I set up my proportion there is no blank so I don’t know how to solve this.” I probed further, “What do you mean there are too many numbers?” He showed me what he had done on the worksheet I had copied for all of my students. He circled all of the numbers that were in the problem, and continued his explanation, “See Mrs. Hassan? I know I need to set up a proportion. I looked at all of the numbers in the problem and there are four. That’s too many. There should only be three.” What I realized was that Isaac was using a keyword strategy that he had been taught at some point in his K-6 math education. He had no idea that circling the year that was given regarding the value of a dollar at a certain point in the past was not going to be helpful to solve the problem. This was the problem Isaac was working on:</p>\n\n<p><a href='http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/sr/documents/cstrtqmath7.pdf' title='' rel=''>http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/sr/documents/cstrtqmath7.pdf</a> (#76</p>\n<p>He circled 2002, 6, 1, and 300, all of the numbers given in the word problem. There was no blank in his proportion for which to solve. His favorite teacher from elementary school, the teacher he loved and trusted, told him that this strategy always works. “Look for the numbers, and the keywords that tell you what to do.” How could I possibly undo the damage of the keyword strategy? At this point, it became my mission to remove the ‘keyword’ strategy from the pedagogy of all teachers I encountered.</p>\n<p>Consider the following problem:</p>\n<>Maria and Louisa were comparing scores from a recent math test. Louisa realized that her score was less than Maria’s. Instead of Maria telling Louisa how many points she earned she decided to tell her a math riddle, “Your score was 2 more than half of my score. “ Louisa earned 13 points on the test. How many points did Maria earn?</>\n<p>Now consider how a student who has been taught the keyword strategy may approach the problem. They see “less than” in the second sentence, the number 2 and “more than” in the third sentence and the number 13 in the fourth sentence. What does that mean to a keyword kid? I need to subtract (less than), then add (more than) 2 to 13? Or maybe I need to use inequality symbols? You think a keyword kid would even recognize the spelled out half as a number? Not likely.</p>\n<p>If we don’t use the keyword strategy, what do we do? Teach a strategy that will help students tackle word problems, not ignore the words or context. A tool that I have found useful has been a tape diagram. Thinking aloud with students and modeling the use of the tape diagram has helped students like Isaac. Let’s see how the Maria and Louisa problem might play out in the classroom using a tape diagram.</p>\n<p>“Louisa realized that her score was less than Maria’s.”</p>\n<>T: Who scored more points, Louisa or Maria?</>\n<>S: Maria.</>\n<>T: Can we draw something to show that Maria got more points than Louisa?</>\n<>S: Yes!</>\n\n<p>“Your score was 2 more than half of my score.”</p>\n<>T: What does this say about Louisa’s score compared to Maria’s?</>\n<>S: Louisa got 2 more points.</>\n<>T: Look back at our tape diagram, who got more points?</>\n<>S: Maria.</>\n<>T: Let’s read that part of the problem again. It doesn’t make sense that Louisa just got 2 more points because her score was less than Maria. What else does the sentence say about Maria’s score?</>\n<>S: She got 2 more than <em>half</em> Maria’s score</>\n<>T: How can we show that Louisa had half of Maria’s score?</>\n<>S: We can divide Maria’s tape into two equal parts, then make Louisa’s tape the length of one part.</>\n\n<>T: Now our diagram looks like Louisa got half the points of Maria. How can we represent the “2 more”?</>\n<>S: Add 2 to Louisa’s tape.</>\n\n<>T: What else do we know about their scores?</>\n<>S: We know that Louisa earned 13 points.</>\n\n<>T: What is the value of the unknown part of Louisa’s tape?</>\n<>S: 13–2=11.</>\n<>T: Let’s label it!</>\n\n<>T: What does Louisa’s tape tell us about the value of each part of Maria’s tape?</>\n<>S: That each part is 11.</>\n<>T: What was Maria’s score on the test?</>\n<>S: She earned 22 points.</>\n<p>The work with tape diagrams can be extended to algebraic equations. With a firm grasp of the situation, a teacher may continue the conversation:</p>\n<>T: If we let Maria’s score be represented by <em>x</em>, can we write an expression to represent Louisa’s score</>\n<>S: Yes. The part of the tape showing the value of 11 is 1/2 <em>x</em> therefore the total length of Louisa’s tape is 1/2 <em>x + 2.</em></>\n<>T: What number were we given that represents the total length of Louisa’s tape?</>\n<>S: 13</>\n<>T: Since 13 and = 1/2 <em>x + </em>2 are expressions representing the same length, we can write the expressions equal to one another. Write the equation</>\n<>S: 13 = 1/2 <em>x + </em></>\n<p>Whether you choose to use tape diagrams to help your students understand word problems or not, think twice about using keywords. There is an Isaac in your classroom that needs something more.</p>\n<p><em>This blog post was written by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stefanie-Hassan-Eureka-Math-Grade-8-and-10-Writer/1607510786201932?fref=ts' title='' rel='nofollow'>Stefanie Hassan</a>, a writer for </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel='nofollow'>Eureka Math</a>, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/Eureka-Math-Grade-6-8-921873154531571/timeline/' title='' rel=''>A Story of Ratio</a>s (6–8) <em>&</em> <a href='https://www.facebook.com/Eureka-Math-Grades-9-12-788314054589598/timeline/' title='' rel=''>A Story of Functions</a> (9–12)</p>	2015-09-16 15:00:17.374961	2015-09-24 01:00:17.673355	<p>One year, about a month before the state test was to be administered, I gave my students one sheet of word problems from the released test items so that they could practice.

138	8	Why Can’t Our Cities Be More Like Video Games?	Smart mayors will enrich the next version of 311 by augmented reality	2015-08-06 14:21:11	362941734f82	<h2>Why Can’t Our Cities Be More Like Video Games?</h2>\n<h4>Smart mayors will enrich the next version of 311 by augmented reality</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RRj2nvLLI8kgtqGXFgrcTg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>In the 2007 best-seller “Spook Country,” William Gibson foresaw “the locative”: virtual fantasies layered over the real-world grid, visible to anyone with the right geo-aware gear. In the book, the charismatic Bobby Chombo is the only guy around with the technical chops needed to make the locative work. So when an artist wants to, say, digitally re-create the death of River Phoenix on Sunset Strip, he or she needs Chombo’s help.</p>\n<p>Cities are real-world grids: you can see that instantly on a Google map. But it’s not so easy to see the city as a civic entity. The stuff that counts — the interaction between people and city services — is hidden in plain view, invisible to almost everyone. That may be about to change. The opportunity: make it possible for cities to show their work and engage with citizens in a meaningful way, using the existing idea of 311. And make everyone who’s interested a Bobby Chombo.</p>\n<p>Today, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1' title='' rel=''>311 services</a> in American cities have the potential to become platforms for citizen engagement — places for genuine back-and-forth among people who care about the streets where they live, as well as channels for interaction between citizens and the city. Although 311 is now thought of as the channel for complaining about city services, it could be the true realization of “the locative.” But more in the spirit of Ben Franklin than the quasi-dystopic Gibson</p>\n<p>If you’re already sold on the idea of civic technology, 311 is pretty nifty. <a href='http://www1.nyc.gov/311/index.page' title='' rel=''>New York City’s version</a>, for example, is essentially the landing strip for everything the city does, and the city’s 311 page and app describe themselves as “The Official Website of the City of New York” as well as the city’s “main source of government information and non-emergency services.</p>\n<p><a href='http://lacity.org/311-directory-online-services' title='' rel=''>Los Angeles’s version of 311</a> is at the top of every website across the city (check out <a href='https://medium.com/backchannel/the-tiny-team-taking-on-a-massive-reform-of-government-it-b5f87b85e2dc' title='' rel=''>lapl.org</a>, <a href='https://medium.com/backchannel/the-tiny-team-taking-on-a-massive-reform-of-government-it-b5f87b85e2dc' title='' rel=''>lacity.org</a>, <a href='https://medium.com/backchannel/the-tiny-team-taking-on-a-massive-reform-of-government-it-b5f87b85e2dc' title='' rel=''>lafd.org</a>, etc.). LA is about to launch a new 311 in the next couple of weeks that will connect callers to drivers in sanitation trucks (and vice versa). (Yes, the Internet is for trash — in a good way!</p>\n<p>I celebrate this civic activity. But it’s all quite primitive so far. Plenty of maps filled with plenty of dots characterize this early stage of 311 development, and the notion of citizen-city “co-creation” of information and services is more talked about than real.</p>\n<p>311 could be much, much neater. What if Bobby Chombo-like help were available to anyone so that she or he could digitally paint special places in the city with arresting puzzles and and insights that, along the way, were joined to civic information made visible to anyone nearby?</p>\n<p>In other words, what if something like <a href='https://www.ingress.com/' title='' rel=''>Ingress</a> and 311 worked together? The idea of adding playful and hip to earnest and helpful seems like a potentially winning civic combination that could make people look at their cities in new ways</p>\n<p>More than 15 million people around the globe have already downloaded Ingress, which uses a smartphone’s GPS tracking and camera to assist players in opening and claiming “portals” — any interesting place in their city, as long as it is accessible by foot — for their team. The idea is that a mysterious alien energy force, the Shapers, is coming into the world through these portals; you can play for the “Enlightened,” who “embrace the power this energy may bestow upon us,” or the “Resistance,” who want to stop it.</p>\n<p>Along the way, though, if you’re at all serious you’ll have to walk dozens of miles to get to many portals — you physically have to be within 90 feet of a portal in order to interact with it. (There are a zillion YouTube videos about Ingress; <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYyd8nU3LIU' title='' rel=''>here’s one</a> in which a user patiently walks through the process with his bored son and not-so-bored dog along for the experience. A Monterey County Weekly reporter, Kera Abraham, recently <a href='http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/cover/google-s-augmented-reality-app-ingress-in-monterey-county/article_c8553962-202b-11e5-a282-2372f84622b2.html' title='' rel=''>engagingly documented</a> her experience leveling-up in Ingress.</p>\n<p>So playing Ingress is a physically-demanding undertaking that gives Google, the host for a startup called Niantic Labs that launched the game, access to (even more) boatloads of data about everything people around the world think is cool in their environments. Millions of people play every day.</p>\n<p>When I look at Ingress, I see the next phase of civic interaction — locative back-and-forth. Cities today routinely use the social-network platforms of Web 2.0 (Twitter, Facebook, blogs) as additional channels for communication with constituents, and that conversation is more two-way than it used to be. With fiber and ubiquitous free public WiFi, cities could use augmented reality apps as yet another means of communication: 311 plus all the future flavors of Ingress-like interfaces.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*yTTeFcVghijkpAiRPPr0BA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Ingress near LA City Hall</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>(Without fiber and free WiFi, users will hit data caps from their mobile carriers that will dim their enthusiasm for interaction with truly engaging augmented reality. And there’s certainly going to be itchiness about favoring the Google-supported Ingress as a channel, so 311 data should be open and fed to anyone who promises to send data back to the city. A good early example of this practice: <a href='http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-garcetti-partnership-waze-20150421-story.html' title='' rel=''>Los Angeles shares</a> data about its construction zones with Waze, also part of Google, in exchange for Waze’s real-time data about traffic patterns and driver experiences.</p>\n<p>Adding a locative element can enhance the civic experience in countless ways, bounded only by imagination. Are you in love with a particular statue in a park or a street crossing? (This is not nuts. In Melbourne, people who love their trees <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/when-you-give-a-tree-an-email-address/398210/' title='' rel=''>wrote appreciative notes</a> to them when each tree was given an email address.) Use augmented reality to see it reimagined as a living, speaking being, telling you a story about the city. And talk back, complaining about the trash at the statue’s foot or suggesting that the park around that statue be reprogrammed to better serve the neighborhood. Build your own visualization for the next user to see</p>\n<p>Look, making things fun is part of civic purpose. Art and music often come first in the process of revitalizing a dead downtown or cheering up a public space. Mayors want people to think “My city is really cool,” because those people will stay. And that has to be good — people with deepened ties to their cities are more likely to support the bold initiatives that will be needed for metros to thrive in an era of economic dislocation, global warming and ever-narrowing resources.</p>\n<p>Augmented reality is going to happen anyway. As long as people are running around celebrating the awesome places in their cities with apps, cities themselves should make clear that they had a lot to do with generating that awesomeness — and that they’re here (really “here”) to stay.</p>\n<p>No Bobby Chombo required.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QXPFTt0jOZKk4eEiVci9cA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>	2015-08-28 03:00:43.968097	2015-08-28 17:00:41.179912	<h2>Why Can’t Our Cities Be More Like Video Games?</h2>\n<h4>Smart mayors will enrich the next version of 311 by augmented reality</h4>

Google is not a conventional company. Larry Page said so in the first letter to shareholders when the company went public in 2004. And in case we missed this, Page <a href='https://abc.xyz/' title='' rel=''>repeated the quote today </a>when announcing that Google, as it existed before August 10, 2015, would thereafter be known as Alphabet. Most of the stuff we <em>interact</em> with from Google — search, ads, YouTube, Gmail, and Android — will be part of just one of several companies under the Alphabet umbrella. At least <em>that</em> company will retain the familiar name</p>\n<p>The other companies — including Google X, Fiber, Calico, Nest, Sidewalk, and Google Ventures — will be fully owned, but separate, each with its own CEO and finances. In that sense, Google will be like Warren Buffett’s universally admired Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomeration of firms bound only by its ownership.</p>\n<p>No one expects Alphabet to operate in the hands-off manner with which Buffett oversees his empire. Page, as CEO of the whole enchilada, will make sure that no executive in his domain will be chief enough to buck his philosophy of thinking big, exploiting technology at scale, and snubbing convention.</p>\n<p>The question is, how separate will those companies be? The sense I get at Google is that this new structure is but an evolution of a process begun when Page stepped back from everyday operations last October and turned over much of Google’s product functions to his key lieutenant <a href='http://www.wired.com/2014/06/sundar-pichai/' title='' rel=''>Sundar Pichai</a> (who now becomes the CEO of Google lite). But Google…er, Alphabet, has seemingly crossed a line by structuring its divisions as separate companies in the Berkshire Hathaway model. At this point, neither Page or anyone else has indicated how thick that line is</p>\n<p>And that’s important. For many years, observers have expressed puzzlement at Google’s adventuresome propensity to generate divisions seemingly built on non sequiturs. What did self-driving cars have to do with search? Can you sell ads with smart thermostats? But when you scratched the surface, you could always figure how such ventures actually did promote Google’s core business. For instance, self-driving cars are huge consumers of Google Maps, and if people are liberated from driving they can do more web searching.</p>\n<p>You could regard those crazy moonshots as wild blood injected into the core business, a perpetual antidote to corporate anemia. Because these divisions were part of Google itself, they could easily share their innovations with the part of the company that consumers used daily. When a team inside Google X invented a learning system informally called the Google Brain, it was soon moved to Google’s Knowledge division to enhance the search engine. Will that process be so easily repeated when Google X is run as a separate company? Or will the research division’s CEO be able to decide that his own firm would be better off selling the team to Microsoft or Yahoo? (I put the question to the company formerly known as Google, and didn’t get an answer. I’m not even sure that the answer to that has been determined.)</p>\n<p>Or consider the role of Tony Fadell, the once and future CEO of Nest, the company Google bought for $3.2 billion in January 2014. Nest now becomes one of the separate Google companies, which may not make much difference because Google was letting Fadell run it as a quasi-independent duchy. But because Nest was part of the larger enterprise, Fadell had been tapped for broader responsibilities at Google, including the reinvention of Google Glass. Will he now relinquish that role to once again run Nest as a single entity? (Nest told me it wasn’t revealing any details in addition to Page’s statement.)</p>\n<p>And what about Fiber, the division of Google devoted to installing and operating high-speed Internet? As I understand it, the mission of Fiber was not necessarily to make money from subscribers but to hasten a higher-speed infrastructure that would make Google’s core products more attractive and profitable. Will its new CEO now have to change direction in order to burnish his own bottom line? (Actually, that could be really interesting — if Fiber bulked up to be a major Internet provider rather than a burgeoning experiment, it might really jolt the incumbents.)</p>\n<p>Obviously, Alphabet is not going full Berkshire Hathaway here. In Buffett’s world, an innovation made at Fruit of the Loom does not quickly get shared at Dairy Queen or Geico. But with Alphabet, Page is granting his divisions at least a measure of more autonomy — and an incentive to optimize for the one and not for the all. As Page writes, “Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence.” It will be fascinating to see how this plays out.</p>\n<p>Scrabble, anyone?</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QXPFTt0jOZKk4eEiVci9cA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>	2015-08-28 03:00:43.24447	2015-08-31 17:00:47.854763	<h2>Google By the Letters</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h4>The search giant is now a conglomerate called Alphabet.

The first thing I have learned about is derived from the people who do this job, this most honorable job on the face of the planet. Teachers, some of the most underpaid soldiers in the evolution of our culture. Money is not the reason why teachers decide to take up teaching. People who choose to teach do so in a similar vein as those who choose the seminary. Teaching is indeed a calling. Many do it because it was their “back up” plan or because it seemed like an easy and linear route to paying bills and being successful in life. But others chose teaching for reasons that are beyond the financial benefits of their occupation. I think to my first year teaching partner. This woman was so invigorated by the opportunity to walk into her classroom and communicate with her students. Her job defined her persona. Not all of us can say that. I cannot say that my job solely defines me. But teachers like her draw energy everyday when the morning bell rings. They truly are compassionate about their craft. These teachers may not take additional qualification courses or may not be up on all the latest buzz-trends of education. It’s mainly because they already have a true ear for what the vocation of teaching entails. These are the teachers that our schools need.</p>\n<p>Some teachers teach because it seems like it would be an “easy job”. Most teachers got A’s and B’s in school and feel as though they are able to pass on the knowledge that they learned about simple curriculum. Those teachers who were once students that sat at the front of class have a definite gift and are imperative to teaching. They take their job seriously. They pass down the tools that once made them smart and successful. They learned from people who were smart and were serious about instilling values and fundamental education to the future. But then there are those teachers who know this but also know <em>that special part</em> that teaching entails. <em>That special part</em> that comes innately to master teachers is the ability to communicate, advise and inspire. These teachers come once in a blue moon. Throughout my public school education, I remember two teachers that stood out. One was my 8th grade homeroom teacher and the other was my 11th grade law teacher</p>\n<p>These two teachers were opposites on the surface but spiritually they were twins. They preached the same things. They talked about things beyond the content of the curriculum while still teaching students what they needed to learn. They taught us curriculum lessons but they spent time teaching or talking about <em>life lessons</em>. My 8th grade teacher once told our class, “All you ever needed to learn from school, you learned in kindergarten. Be fair, share, and treat others the way you want to be treated.” He taught us many other curriculum essentials that year. But that phrase, repeated over and over to us, at least on a weekly basis, rang in my ears for years to come and it still rings true to this day. Life lessons, real communication, these are the markers of great teachers. That is what I have learned</p>	2015-07-16 19:01:08.973227	2015-07-24 15:01:28.940773	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*6hgWc9_jNycuCqAPBDky5w.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>After four years of teaching, I have learned a few things about this profession.

I believed in a free, open, reliable, interoperable Internet: a place where anyone can say anything, and anyone who wants to hear it can listen and respond. I believed in the Hacker Ethic: that information should be freely accessible and that computer technology was going to make the world a better place. I wanted to be a part of making these dreams — the Dream of Internet Freedom — come true. As an attorney, I wanted to protect hackers and coders from the predations of law so that they could do this important work. Many of the people in this room have spent their lives doing that work.</p>\n<>But today, that Dream of Internet Freedom is dying.</>\n<p>For better or for worse, we’ve prioritized things like security, online civility, user interface, and intellectual property interests above freedom and openness. The Internet is less open and more centralized. It’s more regulated. And increasingly it’s less global, and more divided. These trends: centralization, regulation, and globalization are accelerating. And they will define the future of our communications network, unless something dramatic changes.</p>\n<p>Twenty years from now,</p>\n<p>• You won’t necessarily know anything about the decisions that affect your rights, like whether you get a loan, a job, or if a car runs over you. Things will get decided by data-crunching computer algorithms and no human will really be able to understand why.</p>\n<p>• The Internet will become a lot more like TV and a lot less like the global conversation we envisioned 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>• Rather than being overturned, existing power structures will be reinforced and replicated, and this will be particularly true for security.</p>\n<p>•Internet technology design increasingly facilitates rather than defeats censorship and control.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. But to change course, we need to ask some hard questions and make some difficult decisions.</p>\n<p>What does it mean for companies to know everything about us, and for computer algorithms to make life and death decisions? Should we worry more about another terrorist attack in New York, or the ability of journalists and human rights workers around the world to keep working? How much free speech does a free society really need?</p>\n<p>How can we stop being afraid and start being sensible about risk? Technology has evolved into a Golden Age for Surveillance. Can technology now establish a balance of power between governments and the governed that would guard against social and political oppression? Given that decisions by private companies define individual rights and security, how can we act on that understanding in a way that protects the public interest and doesn’t squelch innovation? Whose responsibility is digital security? What is the future of the Dream of Internet Freedom?</p>\n<p><a href='https://medium.com/new-story' title='' rel=''>The Dream of Internet Freedom</a></p>\n<p>For me, the Dream of Internet Freedom started in 1984 with Steven Levy’s book “Hackers, Heroes of the Computer Revolution.” Levy told the story of old school coders and engineers who believed that all information should be freely accessible. They imagined that computers would empower people to make our own decisions about what was right and wrong. Empowering people depended on the design principle of decentralization. Decentralization was built into the very DNA of the early Internet, smart endpoints, but dumb pipes, that would carry whatever brilliant glories the human mind and heart could create to whomever wanted to listen.</p>\n<p>This idea, that we could be in charge of our own intellectual destinies, appealed to me immensely. In 1986, I entered New College, a liberal arts school in Sarasota, Florida. Its motto is “Each student is responsible in the last analysis for his or her education.” That same year, I read the Hacker Manifesto, written by The Mentor and published in Phrack magazine. I learned that hackers, like my fellow academic nerds at New College, were also people that didn’t want to be spoon-fed intellectual baby food. Hackers wanted free access to information, they mistrusted authority, they wanted to change the world — to a place where people could explore and curiosity was its own reward.</p>\n<p>In 1991 I started using the public Internet. I remember sending a chat request to a sysop, asking for help. And then I could see the letters that he was typing appearing in real time on my screen, viscerally knowing for the first time that this technology allowed talking to someone, anyone, everyone, in real time, anywhere. That’s when I really began to believe that the Dream of Internet Freedom could one day become a reality.</p>\n<p>Twenty years ago, I was a criminal defense attorney, and I learned that hackers were getting in trouble for some tricks that I thought were actually pretty cool. As a prison advocate in the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department, I represented a guy who was looking at six more months in jail for hooting into the pay phone and getting free calls home. My research on that case made me realize there were a lot of laws that could impact hackers, and that I could help.</p>\n<p>That was also the year that a guy by the name of Marty Rimm wrote a “study” saying that pornography was running rampant on the Internet. A law review published the paper, and Time Magazine touted it, and that’s all it took for Congress to be off to the races. The cyberporn hysteria resulted in Congress passing the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), an attempt to regulate online pornography.</p>\n<p>For all you porn lovers out there, that would be a big disappointment. But there was something worse about the CDA. To stop porn, the government had to take the position that the Internet wasn’t fully protected by the First Amendment. And that would mean the government could block all kinds of things. The Internet wouldn’t be like a library. The Internet would be like TV. And TV in 1985 was actually really bad.</p>\n<>But this was even worse because we had higher hopes for the Internet. The Internet was a place where everyone could be a publisher and a creator. The Internet was global. And the Internet had <strong>everything</strong> on the shelves. Congress was squandering that promise</>\n<p>At that time, John Perry Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead, a rancher, a founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote what is essentially a poem about love for the Internet. Barlow wrote:</p>\n<>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.</>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*jUJWEAZ4B3BGvUs41aEWGA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Barlow was reacting to the CDA and the assertion that the Internet should be less — not more — free than books and magazines. But he was also expressing weariness with business as usual, and our shared hope that the Internet would place our reading, our associations and our thoughts outside of government control.</p>\n<p>It turns out that Marty Rimm and the Communications Decency Act didn’t kill Internet freedom. Instead, there was a strange twist of fate that we legal scholars like to call “irony”. In 1997 in a case called <em>ACLU v. Reno</em>, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the CDA. It said that the First Amendment’s freedom of expression fully applies to the Internet</p>\n<p>The only part that remains of the CDA is a part that might seem like it achieves the opposite of Congress’s goal to get rid of online porn. It says that Internet providers don’t have to police their networks for pornography or most other unwanted content, and can’t get in trouble for failing to do so. This provision of the CDA is why the Internet is a platform for so much “user generated content,” whether videos, comments, social network posts, whatever.</p>\n<p>Together, the Hacker Ethic, the Hacker Manifesto, and the Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace, <em>ACLU v. Reno</em>, and even the remaining piece of the CDA, describe a more or less radical dream, but one that many, if not most, of the people in this room have believed in and worked for. But today I’m standing here before you to tell you that these dreams aren’t coming true. Instead, twenty years on, the future not only looks a lot less dreamy than it once did, it looks like it might be worse</p>\n<p><strong>Racism and sexism have proven resilient enough to thrive in the digital world.</strong> There are many, many examples of this, but let me use statistics, and anecdotes to make the point</p>\n<p>Statistically: At Google, women make up 30 percent of the company’s overall workforce, but hold only 17 percent of the company’s tech jobs. At Facebook, 15 percent of tech roles are staffed by women. At Twitter, 10 percent.</p>\n<p>Anecdotally: Look around you at your fellow audience members. How very male and white this field is.</p>\n<p>I find this so strange. The security community has historically been very good at finding, cultivating, and rewarding talent from unconventional candidates. Many of the most successful security experts never went to college, or even finished high school. A statistically disproportionate number of you are on the autism spectrum. Being gay or transgender is not a big deal and hasn’t been for years. A 15-year-old Aaron Swartz hung out with Doug Engelbart, creator of the computer mouse. Inclusion is at the very heart of the Hacker ethic.</p>\n<p>And people of color and women are naturally inclined to be hackers. We learn early on that the given rules don’t work for us, and that we have to manipulate them to succeed, even where others might wish us to fail.</p>\n<p>This field should be in the lead in evolving a race, class, age, and religiously open society, but it hasn’t been. We could conscientiously try to do this better. We could, and in my opinion should, commit to cultivating talent in unconventional places.</p>\n<p><strong>Today, our ability to know, modify and trust the technology we use is limited by both the law and our capacity for understanding complex systems. </strong>The Hands On Imperative is on life support.<strong> “</strong>The Freedom to Tinker” might sound like a hobby, but it’s quite important. It means our ability to study, modify and ultimately understand the technology we use — and that structures and defines our lives</p>\n<p>The Hands On Imperative is dying for two reasons. We are limited by both the law and our capacity for understanding complex systems.</p>\n<p>The law: Two examples. It was exactly ten years ago that Black Hat staff spent all night cutting pages out of attendee books and re-stuffing conference sacks with new CDs. Security researcher Mike Lynn was scheduled to give a talk about a previously unknown category of vulnerability, specifically flaws in Internet routers. Cisco, and Mike Lynn’s employer ISS, decided at the last minute to try to keep the vulnerability a secret, ordering Mike to give a different talk and leveraging copyright law to force Black Hat to destroy all copies of Mike’s slides. There’s nothing that cries out censorship like cutting pages out of books.</p>\n<p>On stage the next morning, Mike quit his job, donned a white baseball cap — literally a white hat — and presented his original research anyway. Cisco and ISS retaliated by suing him.</p>\n<p>I was Mike’s lawyer. We managed to fight back that case, and the criminal investigation that the companies also instigated against him. But the message from the lawsuit was loud and clear — and not just to Mike. This is our software, not yours. This is our router, not yours. You’re just a licensee and we’ll tell you what you are allowed to do in the EULA. You can’t decompile this, you can’t study it, you can’t tell anyone what you find.</p>\n<p>Aaron Swartz was another sacrificial lamb on the altar of network control. Aaron was charged with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) because he wrote a script to automate the downloading of academic journal articles. Much of this information wasn’t even copyrighted. But Aaron was a hacker, and he challenged the system. They went after him with a vengeance. The case was based on the assertion that Aaron’s access to the journal articles was “unauthorized” even though he was authorized as a Harvard student to download the same articles.</p>\n<p>Aaron killed himself, under immense stress from prosecutors twisting his arm to plead guilty to a political-career-ending felony, or face years in prison.</p>\n<p>Here, too, the message was clear. You need our permission to operate in this world. If you step over the line we draw, if you automate, if you download too fast, if you type something weird in the URL bar on your browser, and we don’t like it, or we don’t like you, then we will get you.</p>\n<p>In the future will we re-secure the Freedom to Tinker? That means Congress forgoing the tough-on-cybercrime hand waving it engages in every year — annual proposals, to make prison sentences more severe under the CFAA, as if any of the suspected perpetrators of the scores of major breaches of the past two or three years — China, North Korea, who knows who else — would be deterred by such a thing. These proposals just scare the good guys, they don’t stop the attackers.</p>\n<p>We’d have to declare that users own and can modify the software we buy and download — despite software licenses and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>\n<p>This is going to be increasingly important. Over the next 20 years software will be embedded in everything, from refrigerators to cars to medical devices.</p>\n<p>Without the Freedom to Tinker, the right to reverse engineer these products, we will be living in a world of opaque black boxes. We don’t know what they do, and you’ll be punished for peeking inside.</p>\n<p>Using licenses and law to control and keep secrets about your products is just one reason why in the future we may know far less about the world around us and how it works than we currently do.</p>\n<p><strong>Today, technology is generating more information about us than ever before, and will increasingly do so, making a map of everything we do, changing the balance of power between us, businesses and governments. </strong>In the next 20 years, we will see amazing advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Software programs are going to be deciding whether a car runs people over, or drives off a bridge. Software programs are going to decide who gets a loan, and who gets a job. If intellectual property law will protect these programs from serious study, then the public will have no idea how these decisions are being made. Professor Frank Pasquale has called this the Black Box Society. Take secrecy and the profit motive, add a billion pieces of data, and shake</p>\n<p>In a Black Box Society, how can we ensure that the outcome is in the public interest? The first step is obviously transparency, but our ability to understand is limited by current law and also by the limits of our human intelligence. The companies that make these products might not necessarily know how their product works either. Without adequate information, how can we democratically influence or oversee these decisions? We are going to have to learn how, or live in a society that is less fair and less free.</p>\n<p>We are also going to have to figure out who should be responsible when software fails.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*RV8qAo06GXqLsEnsnNS9Jw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>So far, there’s been very little regulation of software security. Yes, the Federal Trade Commission has jumped in where vendors misrepresented what the software would do. But that is going to change. People are sick and tired of crappy software. And they aren’t going to take it any more. The proliferation of networked devices — the Internet of Things — is going to mean all kinds of manufacturers traditionally subject to products liability are also software purveyors. If an autonomous car crashes, or a networked toaster catches on fire, you can bet there is going to be product liability. Chrysler just recalled 1.4 million cars because of the vulnerabilities that Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek are going to be talking about later today. It’s a short step from suing Tesla to suing Oracle for insecure software… with all the good and the bad that will come of that.</p>\n<p>I think software liability is inevitable. I think it’s necessary. I think it will make coding more expensive, and more conservative. I think we’ll do a crappy job of it for a really long time. I don’t know what we’re going to end up with. But I know that it’s going to be a lot harder on the innovators than on the incumbents.</p>\n<p><strong>Today, the physical design and the business models that fund the communications networks we use have changed in ways that facilitate rather than defeat censorship and control.</strong> But before I delve into issues of privacy, security and free expression, let’s take a few steps back and ask how we got to where we are today</p>\n<p>The design of the early public Internet was end-to-end. That meant dumb pipes that would carry anything, and smart edges, where application and content innovation would occur. This design principle was intentional. The Internet would not just enable communication, but would do so in a decentralized, radically democratic way. Power to the people, not to the governments or companies that run the pipes.</p>\n<p>The Internet has evolved, as technologies do. Today, broadband Internet providers want to build smart pipes that discriminate for quality of service, differential pricing, and other new business models. Hundreds of millions of people conduct their social interactions over just a few platforms like TenCent and Facebook.</p>\n<p>What does this evolution mean for the public? In his book The Master Switch, Professor Tim Wu looks at phones, radio, television, movies. He sees what he calls “the cycle.”</p>\n<>History shows a typical progression of information technologies, from somebody’s hobby to somebody’s industry; from jury-rigged contraption to slick production marvel; from a freely accessible channel to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel — from open to closed system.</>\n<p>Eventually, innovators or regulators smash apart the closed system, and the cycle begins afresh. In the book, Tim asks the question I’m asking you. Is the Internet subject to this cycle? Will it be centralized and corporately controlled? Will it be freely accessible, a closed system or something in between?</p>\n<p>If we don’t do things differently, the Internet is going to end up being TV. First, I said we’ve neglected openness and freedom in favor of other interests like intellectual property, and that’s true.</p>\n<p>But it’s also true that a lot of people affirmatively no longer share the Dream of Internet Freedom, if they ever did. They don’t think it’s the utopia that I’ve made it out to be. Rather, the Dream of Internet Freedom collided head on with the ugly awfulness called Other People. Nasty comments, 4chan, /b/tards, revenge porn, jihadists, Nazis. Increasingly I hear law professors, experts in the First Amendment, the doctrine of overbreadth and the chilling effect, talk about how to legislate this stuff they don’t like out of existence.</p>\n<p>Second, there are the three trends I told you about: centralization, regulation and globalization.</p>\n<p>· Centralization means a cheap and easy point for control and surveillance.</p>\n<p>· Regulation means exercise of government power in favor of domestic, national interests and private entities with economic influence over lawmakers.</p>\n<p>· Globalization means more governments are getting into the Internet regulation mix. They want to both protect and to regulate their citizens. And remember, the next billion Internet users are going to come from countries without a First Amendment, without a Bill of Rights, maybe even without due process or the rule of law. So these limitations won’t necessarily be informed by what we in the U.S. consider basic civil liberties.</p>\n<>Now when I say that the Internet is headed for corporate control, it may sound like I’m blaming corporations. When I say that the Internet is becoming more closed because governments are policing the network, it may sound like I’m blaming the police. I am. But I’m also blaming you. And me. Because the things that people want are helping drive increased centralization, regulation and globalization.</>\n<p>Remember blogs? Who here still keeps a blog regularly? I had a blog, but now I post updates on Facebook. A lot of people here at Black Hat host their own email servers, but almost everyone else I know uses gmail. We like the spam filtering and the malware detection. When I had an iPhone, I didn’t jailbreak it. I trusted the security of the vetted apps in the Apple store. When I download apps, I click yes on the permissions. I love it when my phone knows I’m at the store and reminds me to buy milk.</p>\n<p>This is happening in no small part because we want lots of cool products “in the cloud.” But the cloud isn’t an amorphous collection of billions of water droplets. The cloud is actually a finite and knowable number of large companies with access to or control over large pieces of the Internet. It’s Level 3 for fiber optic cables, Amazon for servers, Akamai for CDN, Facebook for their ad network, Google for Android and the search engine. It’s more of an oligopoly than a cloud. And, intentionally or otherwise, these products are now choke points for control, surveillance and regulation.</p>\n<p>So as things keep going in this direction, what does it mean for privacy, security and freedom of expression? What will be left of the Dream of Internet Freedom?</p>\n<p><a href='https://medium.com/new-story' title='' rel=''><strong>P</a>rivacy</strong></p>\n<p>The first casualty of centralization has been privacy. And since privacy is essential to liberty, the future will be less free.</p>\n<p>This is the Golden Age of Surveillance. Today, technology is generating more information about us than ever before, and will increasingly do so, making a map of everything we do, changing the balance of power between us, businesses, and governments. The government has built the technological infrastructure and the legal support for mass surveillance, almost entirely in secret.</p>\n<p>Here’s a quiz. What do emails, buddy lists, drive back ups, social networking posts, web browsing history, your medical data, your bank records, your face print, your voice print, your driving patterns and your DNA have in common?</p>\n<p>Answer: The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) doesn’t think any of these things are private. Because the data is technically accessible to service providers or visible in public, it should be freely accessible to investigators and spies.</p>\n<p>And yet, to paraphrase Justice Sonya Sotomayor, this data can reveal your contacts with “the psychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic, the AIDS treatment center, the strip club, the criminal defense attorney, the by-the-hour motel, the union meeting, the mosque, synagogue or church, or the gay bar.”</p>\n<p>So technology is increasingly proliferating data…and the law is utterly failing to protect it. Believe it or not, considering how long we’ve had commercial email, there’s only one civilian appellate court that’s decided the question of email privacy. It’s the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006, in <em>U.S. v. Warshak</em>. Now that court said that people do have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their emails. Therefore, emails are protected by the Fourth Amendment and the government needs a warrant to get them. This ruling only answers part of the question for part of this country — Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan and Ohio. Because of it, almost all service providers require some kind of warrant before turning over your emails to criminal investigators. But the DOJ continues to push against <em>Warshak</em> in public, but also secretly</p>\n<p>But I want to emphasize how important the ruling is, because I think many people might not fully understand what the reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant requirement mean. It means that a judge polices access, so that there has to be a good reason for the search or seizure, it can’t be arbitrary. It also means that the search has to be targeted, because a warrant has to specifically describe what is going to be searched. The warrant requirement is not only a limitation on arbitrary police action, it should also limit mass surveillance.</p>\n<p>But in the absence of privacy protection — pushed by our own government — the law isn’t going to protect our information from arbitrary, suspicion-less massive surveillance, even as that data generation proliferates out of control.</p>\n<p>Centralization means that your information is increasingly available from “the cloud,” an easy one stop shopping point to get data not just about you, but about everyone. And it gives the government a legal argument to get around the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.</p>\n<p>Regulation is not protecting your data and at worst is actually ensuring that governments can get easy access to this data. The DOJ pushes:</p>\n<p>· Provider assistance provisions to require providers to assist with spying;</p>\n<p>· Corporate immunity for sharing data with the government, for example giving AT&T immunity in its complicity with NSA’s illegal domestic spying and in CISPA, CISA and other surveillance proposals masquerading as security information sharing bills;</p>\n<p>· And, not so much yet in the U.S. but in other countries, data retention obligations that essentially deputize companies to spy on their users for the government.</p>\n<p>Globalization gives the U.S. a way to spy on Americans…by spying on foreigners we talk to. Our government uses the fact that the network is global against us. The NSA conducts massive spying overseas, and Americans’ data gets caught in the net. And, by insisting that foreigners have no Fourth Amendment privacy rights, it’s easy to reach the conclusion that you don’t have such rights either, as least when you’re talking to or even about foreigners.</p>\n<p>Surveillance couldn’t get much worse, but in the next 20 years, it actually will. Now we have networked devices, the so-called Internet of Things, that will keep track of our home heating, and how much food we take out of our refrigerator, and our exercise, sleep, heartbeat, and more. These things are taking our off-line physical lives and making them digital and networked, in other words, surveillable.</p>\n<p>To have any hope of attaining the Dream of Internet Freedom, we have to implement legal reforms to stop suspicion-less spying. We have to protect email and our physical location from warrantless searches. We have to stop overriding the few privacy laws we have to gain with a false sense of online security. We have to utterly reject secret surveillance laws, if only because secret law is an abomination in a democracy.</p>\n<p>Are we going to do any of these things?</p>\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the way many people talk about it, security it isn’t the opposite of privacy. You can improve security without infringing privacy — for example by locking cockpit doors. And not all invasions of privacy help security. In fact, privacy protects security. A human rights worker in Syria or a homosexual in India needs privacy, or they may be killed.</p>\n<p>Instead, we should think about security with more nuance. Online threats mean different things depending on whose interests you have at stake — governments, corporations, political associations, individuals. Whether something is “secure” is a function of whose security you are concerned with. In other words, security is in the eye of the beholder. Further, security need not be zero sum: Because we are talking about global information networks, security improvements can benefit all, just as security vulnerabilities can hurt all.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*gDAyqlrt1d10UbwUn0mV8g.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The battleground of the future is that people in power want more security for themselves at the expense of others. The U.S. Government talks about security as “cyber”. When I hear “cyber” I hear shorthand for military domination of the Internet, as General Michael Hayden, former NSA and CIA head, has said — ensuring U.S. access and denying access to our enemies. Security for me, but not for thee. Does that sound like an open, free, robust, global Internet to you?</p>\n<p>Here’s just one public example: our government wants weakened cryptography, back doors in popular services and devices so that it can surveil us (remember, without a warrant). It is unmoved by the knowledge that these back doors will be used by criminals and oppressive governments alike. Meanwhile, it overclassifies, maintains secret law, withholds documents from open government requests, goes after whistleblowers and spies on journalists.</p>\n<p>Here’s another. The White House is pushing for the Department of Homeland Security to be the hub for security threat information sharing. That means DHS will decide who gets vulnerability information… and who doesn’t.</p>\n<p>I see governments and elites picking and choosing security haves and security have nots. In other words, security will be about those in power trying to get more power.</p>\n<p>This isn’t building security for a global network. What’s at stake is the well-being of vulnerable communities and minorities that need security most. What’s at stake is the very ability of citizens to petition the government. Of religious minorities to practice their faith without fear of reprisals. Of gay people to find someone to love. This state of affairs should worry anyone who is outside the mainstream, whether an individual, a political or religious group or a start up without market power.</p>\n<p><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong></p>\n<p>Today, the physical architecture and the corporate ownership of the communications networks we use have changed in ways that facilitate rather than defeat censorship and control. In the U.S., copyright was the first cause for censorship, but now we are branching out to political speech.</p>\n<p>Governments see the power of platforms and have proposed that social media companies alert federal authorities when they become aware of terrorist-related content on their sites. A U.N. panel last month called on the firms to respond to accusations that their sites are being exploited by the Islamic State and other groups. At least at this point, there’s no affirmative obligation to police in the U.S.</p>\n<p>But you don’t have to have censorship laws if you can bring pressure to bear. People cheer when Google voluntarily delists so-called revenge porn, when YouTube deletes ISIS propaganda videos, when Twitter adopts tougher policies on hate speech. The end result is collateral censorship, by putting pressure on platforms and intermediaries, governments can indirectly control what we say and what we experience.</p>\n<p>What that means is that governments, or corporations, or the two working together increasingly decide what we can see. It’s not true that anyone can say anything and be heard anywhere. It’s more true that your breast feeding photos aren’t welcome and, increasingly, that your unorthodox opinions about radicalism will get you placed on a list.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake, this censorship is inherently discriminatory. Muslim “extremist” speech is cause for alarm and deletion. But no one is talking about stopping Google from returning search results for the Confederate flag.</p>\n<p>Globalization means other governments are in the censorship mix. I’m not just talking about governments like Russia and China. There’s also the European Union, with its laws against hate speech, Holocaust denial, and its developing Right To Be Forgotten. Each country wants to enforce its own laws and protect and police its citizens as it sees fit, and that means a different internet experience for different countries or regions. In Europe, accurate information is being delisted from search engines, to make it harder or impossible to find. So much for talking to everyone everywhere in real time. So much for having <strong>everything</strong> on the Internet shelf</p>\n<p>Worse, governments are starting to enforce their laws outside their borders through blocking orders to major players like Google and to ISPs. France is saying to Google, don’t return search results that violate our laws to anyone, even if it’s protected speech that we are entitled to in the U.S. If you follow this through to the obvious conclusion, every country will censor everywhere. It will be intellectual baby food.</p>\n<p>How much free speech does a free society really need? Alternatively how much sovereignty should a nation give up to enable a truly global network to flourish?</p>\n<p>Right now, if we don’t change course and begin to really value having a place for even the edgy and disruptive speech, our choice is between network balkanization and a race to the bottom.</p>\n<p>Which will we pick?</p>\n<p><strong>The Next 20 Years</strong></p>\n<p>The future for freedom and openness appears to be far bleaker than we had hoped for 20 years ago. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Let me describe another future where the Internet Dream lives and thrives.</p>\n<p>We start to think globally. We need to deter another terrorist attack in New York, but we can’t ignore impact our decisions have on journalists and human rights workers around the world. We strongly value both.</p>\n<p>We build in decentralization where possible: Power to the People. And strong end to end encryption can start to right the imbalance between tech, law and human rights.</p>\n<p>We realize the government has no role in dictating communications technology design.</p>\n<p>We start being afraid of the right things and stop being driven by irrational fear. We reform the CFAA, the DMCA, the Patriot Act and foreign surveillance law. We stop being so sensitive about speech and we let noxious bullshit air out. If a thousand flowers bloom, the vast majority of them will be beautiful.</p>\n<p>Today we’ve reached an inflection point. If we change paths, it is still possible that the Dream of Internet Freedom can become true. But if we don’t, it won’t. The Internet will continue to evolve into a slick, stiff, controlled and closed thing. And that dream I have — that so many of you have — will be dead. If so, we need to think about creating the technology for the next lifecycle of the revolution. In the next 20 years we need to get ready to smash the Internet apart and build something new and better.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QXPFTt0jOZKk4eEiVci9cA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>\n<p><a href='http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/jennifer-granick' title='' rel=''><em>Jennifer Granick </a>is the director of Civil Liberties at the <a href='http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/' title='' rel=''>Center for Internet and Society</a> at Stanford Law School</em></p>\n<p><strong>Do you agree with Granick’s analysis and remedies?

113	6	Masterclass & MOOCs: Notes on the Role of Production Value in Online Learning	In 2012, during a rare moment of clarity, I wondered aloud about the possible impact on institutional reputation of academics choosing to…	2015-08-01 01:38:05	bfc5b1914034	<p>In 2012, during a rare moment of clarity, I wondered aloud about the possible impact on institutional reputation of academics choosing to post their instructional materials online, including lecture videos, for all the world to see. While the efforts by MIT (<a href='http://ocw.mit.edu/about/our-history/' title='' rel=''>starting in 2001</a>) and others behind open content (OER) served as strong social statements about the importance of access to education, they also put the university on display in new ways and to an unprecedented degree. University brass were not typically aware of the practice, despite its potential significance</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*bNBsGUG5gWk3kc5yr14bAA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Source: Masterclass.com</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Soon after, MOOCs (a la Coursera and Udacity) arrived and took the potential impact of freely distributed instructional content on reputation to a whole new level, quickly establishing these online courses as a very public platform for inter-institutional competition. As anticipated, the investment in MOOCs by universities climbed quickly, some reaching the $400,000 level — roughly 2000 percent more than your typical online course. Production value leapt; lighting and sound quality improved, and lectures were no longer freestyle.</p>\n<h3>Taking Course Design Seriously</h3>\n<p>We can interpret the rise in production value of MOOCs as a sign of what’s to come for all of online higher education, or as merely an aberration — a by-product of the one-upmanship that characterized the response by elite institutions to the onset of MOOC-mania. I would argue that it’s the former — for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, higher production value and, more generally, a thoughtful, deliberate, and rigorous approach to course design, remains an untapped opportunity in higher education. Most institutions continue to approach online course design as they have classroom education: the responsibility for course design and development falls largely on the shoulders of lone instructors with limited time, insufficient resources and incentives. Budgets are laughably small. Consequently, most institutions have been unable to truly leverage the possibilities of the medium. Too many courses still rely on repurposed static classroom materials and an incoherent pastiche of free content pulled from a variety of sources.</p>\n<p>But this won’t last. Enough institutions are beginning to recognize the limitations of what now constitutes the “traditional online course” and are beginning to take course design more seriously — improved production value is part and parcel of this change. Better course designs that incorporate real-time feedback, learning analytics, instructional games and other techniques will generate better outcomes, improve retention and from a purely market-perspective, enable the to create a meaningful difference in increasingly competitive, but homogeneous market of learning opportunities.</p>\n<h3>From Providing Access to Knowledge to Designing Learning</h3>\n<p>The inevitability of higher production value also stems from long-term changes in access to instructional materials.</p>\n<p>The ability of individuals to learn when and how they want independently of educational institutions continues to grow. Resources for learning outside of universities are increasingly easy to find, curate, and of better quality. In light of this broad trend, the institution of higher education will necessarily need to place greater emphasis on its capacity to design and deliver high quality learning experiences. The historical emphasis on serving as knowledge creators will need to be complemented by an equal commitment toward providing the highest and most productive form of learning, as well.</p>\n<p>Changes to access to instructional experiences and materials has been migrating away from single institutions since the first printing press, of course, but the growth of the Internet has sent it into overdrive. The trend is not restricted to education. Family physicians, for instance, have had to become accustomed during the past decade to patients arriving for their appointments with medical information in-hand, detailing possible medical interventions — pulled freely from the Internet. Growing consciousness of these changes is one of the factors behind the now common “is college worth it” debate <a href='http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21600131-too-many-degrees-are-waste-money-return-higher-education-would-be-much-better' title='' rel=''>currently making the rounds</a> in North America</p>\n<h3>The Son of MOOC (Or <a href='http://lynda.com/' title='' rel=''>Lynda.com</a> Meets People Magazine</h3>\n<p><a href='https://www.masterclass.com/' title='' rel=''>Masterclass</a> is a VC-backed start-up in (surprise) San Francisco that offers short online courses on popular topics like acting, photography, and creative writing. (Apparently, there’s a shortage of qualified actors, photographers and creative writers.) Each course costs $90 USD and includes video, interactive assignments and social learning opportunities — both online and face-to-face</p>\n<p>While Masterclass seems far removed from the concerns of higher education, its’ similarities to MOOCs offers us a unique vantage point for thinking through changes in production value as well as how instructional resources are typically evaluated.</p>\n<h3>Production Value Squared</h3>\n<p>The first and most obvious similarity is the emphasis on production value, which Masterclass takes to a whole new level. The current crop of Masterclass courses are directed by professional film-makers: Jay Roach (“Austin Powers” and “Meet the Parents”) and two-time Academy Award winning documentarian, Bill Guttentag. The course materials are predictably beautiful.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*mvjQiBfK8dYjNoYyexc4fg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Still from Masterclass.com</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Link to Promotional Video: <a href='https://youtu.be/263TaKp0iok' title='' rel='nofollow'>Masterclass.com</a></p>\n<h3>Privileging the Source in Lieu of Evidence of Learning</h3>\n<p>The second and less obvious similarity is the way in which both MOOCs and Masterclass rely on the status of the source of instruction to define the perception of instructional value.</p>\n<p>The affiliation with elite institutions is fundamental to the appeal and newsworthiness of MOOCs, as was the choice to present these courses as more or less equivalent to the “real courses” taught within the institution (minus tuition). News services and pundits took notice because MOOCs appeared to offer a desirable, expensive, and scare resource for free — “<a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/elite-education-for-the-masses/2012/11/03/c2ac8144-121b-11e2-ba83-a7a396e6b2a7_story.html' title='' rel=''>Elite Education for the Masses</a>”, Washington Post, 2012. Had these MOOCs come from, for example, a consortium of community colleges in South Dakota, or not been understood as consistent with the actual courses taught at these institutions, they would have generated far less attention</p>\n<p>Likewise, Masterclass leverages the brand names of its instructors — in this case, celebrities from the world of film, sports, and the arts. The first crop of Masterclass courses are taught by Dustin Hoffman (actor), Serena Williams (tennis pro), James Patterson (author), and Annie Liebowitz (photographer). (While it’s highly unlikely that the celebrities had anything to do with the design of the instruction, this is how the courses are marketed.)</p>\n<p>In both MOOCs and Masterclass, then, the value of the courses is based to a considerable degree on the source of the instruction. And in presenting themselves in this fashion, these two examples inadvertently underline the unsophisticated way in which instructional quality is commonly evaluated in <em>and</em> outside of higher education. MOOCs were received well because of the status of the institutions with which they were affiliated. But this status is not typically the result of instructional quality, but exclusivity (admissions and tuition levels) and the research productivity of the faculty. These institutions enrol the most academically gifted students and, as Harvard Professor <a href='http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/11/13/clayton-christensen-why-online-education-is-ready-for-disruption-now/' title='' rel=''>Clayton Christensen has noted</a>, his home institution spends far less on improving instruction each year than does the University of Phoenix. Similarly, the status of celebrities leading the Masterclass courses is not the result of their success as educators or coaches. They are practitioners and each one studies under leading coaches, trainers and educators</p>\n<p>In each of these two examples, consumers are making evaluations of instructional quality on the basis of factors only indirectly related to instructional quality. This isn’t because consumers of education are daft, rather, it’s because in the absence of easy access to relevant information about instructional value, we tend to turn to proxies of quality to guide our decisions, what Lloyd Armstrong, Provost Emeritus at USC described as “<a href='http://www.changinghighereducation.com/2014/12/new_business_model_view_of_change_in_higher_education.html' title='' rel=''>surrogates of quality</a>”</p>\n<p>Consumers need to become more adept at identifying instructional value. But this will require institutions to learn how to measure the impact of different instructional strategies on learning outcomes and to use this information to inform to guide the development of better strategies. Yes, educational quality is harder to measure than most, but not impossible — particularly in the online environment. Intelligently designed learning analytics, for example, can now provide us with accurate and relevant information to enable better assessments of true quality in learning.</p>	2015-08-01 03:00:58.295033	2015-08-05 17:00:49.606205	<p>In 2012, during a rare moment of clarity, I wondered aloud about the possible impact on institutional reputation of academics choosing to post their instructional materials online, including lecture videos, for all the world to see.

112	6	But I Can’t “Just Do It”!	How many times have you heard this?\nIt’s sounds so simple -	2015-08-01 01:40:23	8ba9b18a6dbe	<p>How many times have you heard this?\nIt’s sounds so simple -</p>\n<p><strong>Just Do It!</strong></p>\n<p>Change is happening all over the place. In fact, so many of us jump into change that is rather life altering — marriage, children, new jobs…. pretty life altering! I mean, these changes are BIG!</p>\n<p>Really, it’s not that people are totally afraid of changing.</p>\n<p>New hair styles, wardrobe redos, new menu choices…. they’re all changes.</p>\n<p>I know I’ve read more than a few blog articles about no longer accepting the “excuses” for not changing — there needs to be a change and we need to move on — NOW!</p>\n<p><strong>Sometimes We See that Change is Necessary</strong></p>\n<p>I’m transitioning myself through a major life change — one that is extremely exciting — and scary and terrifying and exhausting and ……. but necessary.</p>\n<p>I could no longer ignore that change needed to happen. I wasn’t happy, my family wasn’t happy. We made the decision — discussing it with my wife — to move on and try a new path.</p>\n<p>To what, I not really sure but the rut was starting to get too deep. I wasn’t seeing things with new lenses anymore. I was starting to look for “easy” solutions at times — not the right solutions. In short, I was not being the educational leader I expected myself to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Sometimes we wander across just the right thing at the right time.</strong></p>\n<p>A while back on twitter I happened upon this <a href='http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324354704578635900864791348' title='' rel=''>tweet</a></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*CxI9QrfMUjL_AG4Z.jpg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>As I read through the article there were so many things that struck me as being important in the educational context.</p>\n<p><strong><em>1. Healing takes time — change requires healing time</strong></em></p>\n<p>Often I’ve heard <em>“Well, they need to get over it. That’s the way it is and it’s time to get with the times. There’s a new train leaving and either they’re on it or …” </em>In fact, the number of articles that are almost hostile to people who aren’t willing to change as quickly as it is deemed they <em>should</em> is somewhat surprising given we are suppose to be an empathetic and concerned group of individuals</p>\n<p>As an administrator who has been involved in working with a number of staffs in different schools on improvement and change — I didn’t always understand this and often thought “<em>Let’s move on. We’ve been going over this and rehashing this.</em>” I didn’t understand that, as the educational leader, I needed to listen to where they were in the change process — not where I was or where I wanted to be. But that’s only the start — the next step is empathizing and then help them move forward with the understanding that staying put isn’t an option and support will be in place to transition. But the either/or method isn’t really effective — people may “look” like they are moving forward</p>\n<p><strong><em>2. Telling someone that change is going to happen doesn’t eliminate the need for time for healing.</strong></em></p>\n<p>As a parent, this has been so real for my wife and me. We have lived in many different communities. As parents, we learned that we needed to discuss a move with our children well before it happened BUT that didn’t mean the children wouldn’t need time.</p>\n<p>I recall my oldest boy, days before we were moving. He had never really experienced leaving friends. There he was, with his best friend, walking behind our house in the late evening along the back road. The two of them, arms over each others’ shoulders walking — occasionally talking — stopping to look, point, talk.</p>\n<p>It nearly broke my heart as I watched these two friends help one another — tears rolling down my cheeks as I witnessed friendship as it best.</p>\n<p>Later that night, before bed, we talked about how he was feeling. LIke it was yesterday, his reply was “<em>I’ll be okay. I know it will be okay. I just need time to get use to this.</em>” He was 8. He taught me that change was okay — but it wasn’t easy no matter how much advanced warning</p>\n<p>As an administrator, I constantly remember this as I have worked with teachers, parents and students moving through the change process. As a prime example, after moving to a new school, our staff was in the middle of a planning meeting as the old school was being demolished. Many of the teachers couldn’t concentrate on the meeting we were having — the old school being torn down! We stopped. Watched. Some tears were shed. Memories were shared. They knew for 2 years that this was going to happen. It didn’t make it easier.</p>\n<p>We took a break. People wandered outside. Some had spent nearly 30 years teaching in the school. They knew rationally that it needed to be done — but 30 years of drama, sports, graduations, first days….. you don’t just walk away.</p>\n<p>Too often, in the name of progress, the rush to change becomes a litany of initiative after initiative in the name of “Doing what’s best for students” with new ideas coming from all over the place. Telling people that change is coming doesn’t mean you don’t have to help them when it actually happens. Again, empathy is a big part of this and giving teachers a list of 10 things isn’t empathetic. Neither is listing all the benefits or, like I’ve seen, ridiculing those who aren’t changing in forums of those who’ve changed. The last one, sorry to say, is somewhat of a staple in some twitter circles and is so embarrassing that people with fairly large followings talk about other people like that yet do it in the name of “What’s best for students”.</p>\n<p>Exactly what would children learn from that?</p>\n<p>Another group I’ve especially seen this with is new teachers. “10 things to you need to know as you begin teaching” is a great title but if you’re really concerned about new teachers, you’ll talk to them — constantly — not just at the beginning of the year or during the new teacher follow-up meetings or class observations. Even if it means making a note to yourself to stop by after school or in the morning to “talk” (I mean listen) to them, it’s needed. They need to “hear” from you in more than emails, memos and observations. And, no, you don’t have the answers — they aren’t asking questions but working through change. Give them a wonderful gift, your attention!</p>\n<p><strong>3. Change goals are too vague and too longterm.</strong></p>\n<p>“It’s what’s best for students” isn’t good enough anymore. For everyone who pulls this phrase out when referring to school reform and the advancement of technology, quit saying it because I can give you a whole grocery list of items that would fall in this category and fulfill the criteria.</p>\n<p>And the rationale that “It’s what is happening everywhere outside of school” is another one that needs to hit the dumpster for the same reason as above. Again, there’s a grocery list of things that fit here. Yes “everyone is on ______________” but, that’s doesn’t mean it’s for everyone or that we will find the same fulfillment/satisfaction/learning/growth. This is as ridiculous as saying we’ll teach all the students in our room the same way with the same material and expect them all to learn and be excited about it. How about let’s stop this “one size fits all” for everyone in education and, instead, help teachers with some long-term goals for change and then short-term feedback goals for success. “Everyone’s doing it” is something a teenager says to their parents not something that I would expect in a conversation concerning educational change that is impacting the lives of teachers.</p>\n<p>Goals need to be specific — we’re moving to use ePortfolios because….. — and have the people doing the change fill in some of the reasons because there are people who will be ready and accepting of the change and be prepared to move things forward. Constant initiatives from out there “in the best interest of students” hasn’t really worked so far — why do we expect them to suddenly work? Be specific about the change. Set a longterm goal — but then set short term goals and allow people to move forward, make mistakes and work through the changes. Give time for feedback and reflection that can then be integrated into the next step.</p>\n<p>Give individuals the assistance they need to move forward, hold them accountable and be expected to be amazed.</p>\n<p>As an administrator, one thing I’ve encountered numerous times is the “3 year plan — 1 year mindset”. The initiative is given 3 years to be fully implemented but that is 2 years longer than the timelines given for seeing results. There will always be those people who want to impress and will be willing to “succeed” at all costs — but in education, the human cost — especially when it relates to teachers, students and parents — is just too much. Either live by the 3 years or stop the smoke and mirrors and be honest about the change timeline. People may not be happy but they will know what is expected of them — especially the leaders in the school — and adjust accordingly. Support for a 3 year initiative is much different than that of a 1 year initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Not everyone moves at the same rate or has the same needs</strong></p>\n<p>Individual needs are not usually part of the planning process when discussing change. People talk about them and acknowledge them but don’t plan for the differences. Instead, whether it’s teachers within a school or schools within a division/district, the expectation is that the change will look and proceed along a certain path and, if it doesn’t, there is something wrong with the person/school and nothing at all wrong with the plan.</p>\n<p>Educational leaders talk about students with different learning needs yet I’m still somewhat astounded at how similar so many classrooms look. Talk isn’t action and for the latter to occur there needs to be specific planning and supports integrated to help with the transition. There is a large hue and cry for change — assessment, planning, cross-curricular integration, technology integration, flipped classrooms, blended learning, inquiry learning. Yet, it’s astounding how most of these come with a small range of implementation and time-lines.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Not all Teachers are the same!</strong></p>\n<p>Planning for different needs and different progress is messy and isn’t without problems — which you would think would be understood given the situation. Yet, it is not uncommon to have educational leaders compare teacher A to B&C&D because A is a “rock star”. The reasons for this are numerous but it’s usually doesn’t have the desired impact. Which, really shouldn’t be a surprise. Instead, leaders should be a) continuing to support teacher A with their work but also providing support for B, C & D. Not being a “rock star” shouldn’t be seen as a negative or be used as a comparison of ability. Instead, plan for individual differences, identify who might need assistance, be open to working with them and provide supports with short-term goals and help to move them along. Too often, the expectation is that with adults, the learning will be similar for everyone and, as organizations, the same inputs will provide consistent results across the domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Change isn’t an event — it’s a movement.</strong></p>\n<p>Individuals need time to move through significant change. Too often, because teachers are adults, the assumption is that they will not need that much time or they will be able to rationally see the need for change and will “Get on with it.” As Chip and Dan Heath explore in their book<a href='http://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/' title='' rel=''> <strong>Switch</a></strong></p>\n<><em>Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives? The primary obstacle, say the Heaths, is a conflict that’s built into our brains. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems — the rational mind and the emotional mind — that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort — but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.</em></>\n<p>Too often, this mistake becomes costly in terms of the human factor which then affects the school culture and, well, my experience in changing these errors is that it leads to a negative and unproductive working and learning environment. Maybe it’s time that people focused more on the individuals in the change process and less time telling them to “just get on with it.” because “there’s no excuse not to move on.” In my experience, there may not be an excuse but there is a reason and, if you take the time, not only will you find out why but you’ll be amazed at the change that will take place.</p>	2015-08-01 03:00:57.698874	2015-08-06 15:01:00.137097	<p>How many times have you heard this?\nIt’s sounds so simple -</p>\n<p><strong>Just Do It!</strong></p>\n<p>Change is happening all over the place. In fact, so many of us jump into change that is rather life altering — marriage, children, new jobs…. pretty life altering! I mean, these changes are BIG!</p>
147	8	How Chicago Got Smart About Sensors	The Array of Things will be the central nervous system of cities. Without invading your privacy.	2015-09-22 16:23:28	207b6429870c	<h3>How Chicago Got Smart About Sensors</h3>\n<p></p>\n<h4>The Array of Things will be the central nervous system of cities. Without invading your privacy.</h4>\n<p></p>\n\n<p>I’ve been excited about the <a href='https://twitter.com/arrayofthings' title='' rel=''>Array of Things </a>— a network of beautifully-designed sensors poised to capture and make public real-time, non-personal data about the livability of a city — ever since it (they?) started following me on Twitter in <a href='http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-06-19/chicago-is-your-big-friendly-brother' title='' rel=''>June 2014</a>. A sensor network with a personality and a public service mission — what more could a responsive city want? I was happy to let it follow me, and followed it back so I could read <em>its</em> tweets</p>\n<p>This month, the Array of Things moved several giant steps closer to becoming a crucial general-purpose, worldwide sensor data infrastructure for researchers and policymakers. New money from the National Science Foundation is coming in, new collaborators from around the world are learning about it, and 50 devices will be installed on the streets of Chicago in early 2016, with hundreds more to be added in the years to come. Most importantly, the leaders of the initiative (the City of Chicago and the University of Chicago’s <a href='http://www.urbanccd.org/#urbanccd' title='' rel=''>Urban Center for Computation and Data</a>) are committed to openness and public consultation — which means the Array of Things initiative will continue to thrive</p>\n<p>Meet the <a href='http://arrayofthings.github.io/' title='' rel=''>Array of Things</a></p>\n\n<p>Courtesy U Chicago’s Urban Center for Computation and Data. It’s a board on which sensors have been mounted that can measure things that affect life in a city: climate, air quality, light, vibration, numbers of pedestrians or cars passing the node, climate, and ambient noise. The board also provides room for a computer, a communication device, and a power control device. Every one of these things — sensors and other elements of the overall system — can be swapped in or out as needed. Nothing hard-wired or glued together to prevent maintenance (compare this to your smartphone). The shield protecting the devices, the overall skin for each board, has been designed by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. So these sensor clusters will be eye-catching, attractive structures suited for urban landscapes.</p>\n<p>Each node will be mounted on a pole (or building) and connected to a power source and a connection to the Internet. Think of it as a city fitness tracker, continuously measuring the block-by-block physical environment of a city.</p>\n<p>The recent award of $3 million in NSF funding — announced at a <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-smart-cities-initiative-help' title='' rel=''>White House summit</a> last week — will cover the engineering and software development needed to deploy 500 of these devices throughout Chicago by the end of 2017. Next month, three prototypes will be created from which the project leaders and City partners will choose the version that best balances aesthetics and functionality with ease of installation. The electronics involved need to be protected from harsh weather while simultaneously being exposed enough to measure what they’re supposed to</p>\n<p>And here’s a cheer for the <a href='http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/about-us/our-principles/' title='' rel=''>Smart Chicago Collaborative</a>, a civic organization focused on improving lives in Chicago through technology, that will be working with this initiative to, as Executive Director Daniel O’Neil <a href='http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/toward-a-smart-city-that-works-for-everyone/' title='' rel=''>puts it</a>, “consider the general public’s use cases for the network and creating applications relevant to everyday life in Chicago.” Smart Chicago, O’Neil says, will ensure that the “voice of residents [is heard] in the development of the AoT platform through convenings and other modes of communication [and] collaboration.” That’s extraordinarily important; responsive cities listen to what communities want</p>\n<p>What happens first in Chicago may well affect many of us. Earlier this month, ninety people from fifteen cities, mostly employed by research entities that already have strong relationships with their own city halls, came to Chicago to learn about the Array of Things and dream about the projects they’d like to do using deployed sensors. (The localities included American cities Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, New York City, and Winter Park, FL; UK cities Bristol, Glasgow, and Newcastle; as well as Amsterdam. Mexico City, and Eindhoven in Norway.) Representatives from about a dozen cities said they’d like to deploy a few, and the University of Chicago initiative leaders got <a href='https://cie.uchicago.edu/article/uchicago-innovation-fund-invests-more-500000-teams-working-multiple-sclerosis-array-things' title='' rel=''>support from the UChicago Innovation Fund</a> to build devices for purposes of loaning them out, license-free, to nonprofits or universities elsewhere. The other cities can then help with evaluation and troubleshooting of these new systems, lending their engineering expertise to the Chicago team</p>\n<p>As Charlie Catlett, the director of UChicago’s Urban Center for Computation and Data, and a senior computer scientist at Argonne National Lab, puts it, “What we were trying to do with this workshop was create a sustainable community. Among the shared values of that community is the idea that the real benefit of this data is best achieved by making it public and free.”</p>\n<p>This is the breathtaking, crucial, central element of the Array of Things mindset: the whole thing is aimed at creating a repository of public, free, real-time data in a single place. All the devices are set to communicate only with the Chicago researchers. No outsider can initiate a connection to one of these nodes. When the device connects to the central location in Chicago — at Argonne National Lab — it drops its data there, receives an acknowledgement that the data was received, and then deletes the data from its own local storage place. The City of Chicago, in turn, will take a feed of data from Argonne and pull it into its own <a href='https://data.cityofchicago.org/' title='' rel=''>open data portal</a></p>\n<p>Presto: data is available to the city it came from, any other city can compare its data to the Chicago-stored data, and everyone’s learning — without having to pay a company for an elaborate proprietary system. (Carnegie-Mellon and Georgia Tech are already testing sensor devices, and the Chicago workshop also focused on ensuring that data from those sensors is available in Chicago in standardized form — accompanied by latitude and longitude information, for example, and using a consistent form of time-stamping.)</p>\n<p>Here’s another amazing, all-important element of this Chicago story: personal privacy is front and center for the city and its collaborators at the University of Chicago and around the world, as both a matter of substance and process.</p>\n\n<p>First, substance. The Array of Things is not counting MAC addresses on smartphones. Too personal. One of the sensors is a camera, but there’s a processor inside each Array of Things device that will use the camera’s images to count the numbers of pedestrians, bicycles, and cars that have passed by. Once that’s done, the system will discard the image. As Catlett explains, “The image from the camera never gets stored or transmitted.” Only the counts leave the device. Similarly, identifiable sound data will be processed within the node and discarded — all that gets transmitted out is the numerical level of ambient noise the sensor is picking up. This initiative is about monitoring the city’s environment and activity, not individuals.</p>\n<p>Second, process. The City of Chicago, through its Chief Information Officer, Brenna Berman, has the deciding vote on a committee (co-chaired by Catlett) that is tasked with deciding whether particular new sensors are appropriate for the Array. That governance board, in turn, is advised by a technically-adept, independent cybersecurity and privacy advisory board chaired by Von Welch, director of Indiana University’s Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research and Kevin Moran, chief technology officer for the City of Chicago.</p>\n<p>So, for example, if someone wants to add a 3D hologram <a href='https://medium.com/backchannel/why-can-t-our-cities-be-more-like-video-games-362941734f82' title='' rel=''>art installation</a> to the capabilities of the Array of Things, a description of the data privacy implications of that idea will be reviewed by the external committee — who will then help the governance board decide whether the risk of the new sensor is appropriate. Before deploying the first devices on its streets, the City will put proposed privacy policy principles out for public comment</p>\n<p>Just imagine the possibilities. Sensors monitoring air quality, sound and vibration (to detect heavy vehicle traffic), and temperature can be used to suggest the healthiest and unhealthiest walking times and routes through the city, to take a hard look for standing water or flooding, or to study the relationship between diseases and the urban environment.</p>\n<p>For example, some parts of the west side of Chicago have a much higher incidence of asthma than other parts of the city. If the city had more facts about air quality on the west side, block-by-block, it could work on deploying green spaces where they are most needed. And with data from other cities available for comparison, Chicago (“The Great American City” — or so it tells New York City) can measure itself against the rest.</p>\n<p>Improving walkability and transport; facilitating nuanced urban design aimed at mitigating heat islands; block-by-block correlation of air quality and noise with disease; unanticipated, innovative uses of fine-grained data built by outside parties using open Array of Things data — we expect great things from the Array of Things, all based on the values of openness and public consultation that have animated the project from the beginning.</p>\n<p>Including more Tweeting.</p>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>	2015-09-22 17:00:37.12508	2015-09-24 01:00:37.412029	<h3>How Chicago Got Smart About Sensors</h3>\n<p></p>\n<h4>The Array of Things will be the central nervous system of cities.

129	8	I’ve Spent A Lifetime Building a Mighty Network. Here Are My Secrets.	\N	2015-08-26 14:38:41	8590d893d30c	<h3>I’ve Spent A Lifetime Building a Mighty Network. Here Are My Secrets.</h3>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Rule One: Take pleasure in it. It’s not just a safety net, it’s YOUR net.</h4>\n\n<p>I’ve long been told that I “know everyone.” In other words, I have a great network, one that’s an object of envy. My jokey rejoinder is that I’m old, and so have had a lot of jobs. The deeper truth is that my collection of contacts isn’t just the result of a peripatetic career. Working in and around technology for a long time means that in addition to my own moves, virtually all of my acquaintances, friends and friends-of-friends have also changed places in our always-be-disrupting world.</p>\n<p>But an even larger factor is that I am a <a href='http://gladwell.com/are-you-a-connector/' title='' rel=''>connector</a>, as Malcolm Gladwell described it. I’m always curious about people, and enjoy collecting stories: where do you live, what do you do, where did you come from, what would you like to do? And so I’m always open to meeting new people. When I do, immediately the wheels turn. How can I help this one find answers, get good advice? Who has what in common with whom? Who would this person enjoy and benefit from meeting</p>\n<p>You might not be as driven as I am by the connecting part. That’s OK. But as we hurtle along towards a <a href='http://www.wired.com/insights/2013/09/the-gig-economy-the-force-that-could-save-the-american-worker/' title='' rel=''>gig economy</a>, experience <a href='http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsfaqs.htm#anch41' title='' rel=''>frequent job changes</a>, and acclimate ourselves to living with <a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/churchplantmedia-cms/paseodelrey/continuous-partial-attention.pdf' title='' rel=''>continuous partial attention</a>, it’s more important than ever to nurture a vast personal network — people you can tap for ideas, referrals, and support. Properly tended, this network is your currency, your brain trust, your reality check</p>\n<p>I define a network as a group of personal connections that grows over time and through experiences. Mine includes people I failed to hire, or who failed to hire me; people from agencies my company worked with; people to whom I referred a candidate; recruiters, designers, fellow scribes, conference pals, and many, many former colleagues who range from engineers and product managers to HR and biz dev pros.</p>\n<p>Your list needn’t be that different. Your network can include friends from school, from internships, early jobs. And it can also include someone you bond with at a dinner party or weekend away, the friend of a friend who works at a company you admire, your hair stylist or mechanic, casual colleagues at your job, your neighbors, your parents’ friends (and yes, your kids’ friends). By the way, cultivating this lot is not the same as being on LinkedIn or Facebook (more on this below).</p>\n<p>But first, a cautionary note. Building a network isn’t meant to be an exercise in the law of large numbers. Less important to me is the number of, say, Google Contacts I have (for the record, it’s around 4400), but who they are. These are people first, not your <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_flipping' title='' rel=''>bits to flip</a>. So keep a few rules in mind</p>\n<li><strong>Don’t treat your network like an ATM</strong> you can hit up for withdrawals at any time. No one likes to feel used repeatedly, especially when it’s one-sided</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t be strictly transactional </strong>(you get a job tip, you give a job tip, the end). The beauty of a good network is that it’s multi-dimensional, not only about the one immediate need (hey, it’s just like our lives). You might have, or need, advice on eldercare or childcare; your old work buddy might have the best advice on kid-friendly trips or finding a divorce lawyer. By the way, there’s no expiration date on you or your contacts doing one another a solid</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t limit your contacts to one context. </strong>This is the biggest obstacle people give themselves: their requirements about who they <strong>think</strong> they should meet are extremely narrow. They can’t see that anyone else will have “value.” (This is why I’m careful with introductions — and I don’t offer again if there’s no follow-up.</li>\n<p>You might wonder about how to maintain or add to your network over time. There’s plenty of info out there on <a href='http://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/609-best-contact-apps.html' title='' rel=''>apps to manage your contacts</a> and <a href='http://theweek.com/articles/465649/10-superhelpful-mnemonic-tricks' title='' rel=''>mnemonic tricks</a> to remember bits and bobs about people you meet, so I won’t cover that here. Instead I’d encourage you to apply the principles I’m outlining to your overall approach. Tools come later</p>\n<p>I think of my own network as a living organism, one I work to nurture consistently, and from which I occasionally draw for a specific need. (Gardening metaphors are not out of place.)</p>\n<p>In order to build up great contacts (and friends) over time, here are the main touchpoints:</p>\n<p><strong>Be helpful. </strong>When someone reaches out, just do it.<strong> </strong>Among my coffee dates: media executives moving from New York to the Bay Area who want to understand the ecosystem; PR pros wanting to jump from tech to consumer, or vice versa, and (quite a few) veteran journalists one step ahead of a pink slip at a collapsing publication. Most of the time I can’t offer instant resolution. I just hear them out, paint the picture I know, and think broadly about useful advice and interesting people who can further the conversation. I do this simply because I believe that we all need help along the way, to figure out next steps, clarify priorities, perhaps hear a snippet of an idea or get a sense of the landscape. <strong>Each of us will need some of these things eventually.</strong> Just don’t get all <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo' title='' rel=''>quid pro quo</a> about it. Pay it forward</p>\n<p><strong>Keep in loose touch. </strong>Because I tend to remember something about the interests or expertise of my contacts, every now and again I share information (it could be a Tweet, an article, joke, cartoon, video) on that topic just to say hi, see what’s up. Last summer I met a Twitter-only friend face to face in London. We made a great connection, and continue to trade tidbits and referrals. I’ve introduced him to people who can help him find projects, and for whom he can do the same. “Loose touch” keeps you limber for future brainstorming and referrals</p>\n<p><strong>But when you’re on the hunt for real, be more communicative.</strong> When you’re actively seeking a specific job or company or introduction, regularly thank your contacts (regardless of what they did along the way) and inform them as your process unfolds. I was delighted to get a thank-you note from a young woman I met after she followed up with each referral I gave her. She let me know about the state of her search and how she enjoyed each meeting I orchestrated. She too is a good networker. Of course, if your contacts are the precise reason you got what you wanted, go all out with the thank-you’s. I’ve gotten from and sent gifts to both the newly hired gal or guy and the hiring manager</p>\n<p><strong>Weak ties are important. </strong>Depending on what you need, your closest friends may not be the best resource. Don’t forget to keep up with your <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties' title='' rel=''>weak ties</a> — the people who are likely to be more remote, occasional and not obvious contacts. (You’d never ask a weak tie to pick you up at the airport.) In fact these are the people who may give you the leads and information that take you farthest. One example: I was recruited for my current job by a friendly acquaintance I would characterize as a weak tie. Since then, I’ve made three weak-tie referrals to the company myself, all hired</p>\n<p><strong>Make good referrals. </strong>Now and then I sit down with friends or contacts in a service business to hear about their offering so I can refer the right people to them. When you understand your friend’s specialty or what their firm does, your referrals are more valuable. Knowing about a multinational event production firm is great if your marketing contacts work for a big company, too, but that’s not as useful for your pal’s 3-person startup. Take in all information, and use your judgment to make good calls</p>\n<p><strong>Keep your word. </strong>If you proffer leads, follow through to make introductions or forward information. And if you intend to help out, do it right away — don’t toy with people who need help! I should also mention that if you truly can’t help — you don’t have any expert contacts or ideas — just say so, kindly. Don’t leave the request dangling. You too will want that aboveboard treatment when it’s your turn</p>\n<p><strong>Network, not social network. </strong>All of this might strike you as a lot of work. Can’t you just post on Facebook, or Tweet, or query LinkedIn or Quora and be done with it? Each of these platforms certainly has a place for finding and trading on information and connections. But don’t limit yourself to them, as you’ll get random, self-selected responses, none as detailed or nuanced or private as you might need. And whether it’s private or public, these platforms default to lazy (if well-intentioned) responses. We’ve all chimed in with 3- or 4-word replies to a question posed to a group. Nothing is going to give you the same quality and depth as your personal network can. But honestly, a 1:1 connection that lives over time is much more rewarding than 1:some</p>\n<p><strong>Make a list. Check it twice. </strong>Pause your regular routine every week or two and reflect on what you need answers to, or who’s asking for your help and ideas. Make a list of who and what, and then follow up with brief notes</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, make introductions correctly. </strong>When you want to help, and have ideas for who should meet whom, write to your contact personally and ask if they mind an introduction. <em>Only when they say OK</em> should you briefly introduce the two parties, and then get out of the way. You don’t need to be part of the conversation. Give your friends the gift of connecting with one another. <em>Pro tip:</em> put the connector to bcc: in email, or ask to be dropped off if you’re that person. I’m amazed at how often the originator gets stuck in the to and fro of setting up a chat</p>\n<p>We live in a world of many unknowns. The more you can learn from others (about a job opening, medical advice, travel destinations, how to change careers, gaining any kind of foothold) helps you see around corners; the more you can ask for or give help to others on their path, the more knowns emerge — and we’re all better off. So, throw off your zero-sum blinders and get going.</p>\n<p>And if these tips work for you, ping me. This could be the beginning of a beautiful weak tie.</p>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>\n<p><strong>Is Voltaire’s advice — to tend to your own garden? — the best way to grow a network?

135	8	Everything You Know About the Internet of Things is Wrong	It’s not about gadgets — it’s about making hardware part of our connected world	2015-08-03 12:27:42	c3575ed6e63e	<>(Flickr/NASA)</>\n<h2>Everything You Know About the Internet of Things is Wrong</h2>\n<h4>It’s easy to misunderstand the IoT because the term itself — or even discussing the phenomenon in isolation — is horribly misleading</h4>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RRj2nvLLI8kgtqGXFgrcTg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is something we’re hearing a lot about right now. It’s at the peak of the hype cycle. We’ve all seen the statistics: estimates of between <a href='http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2905717' title='' rel=''>25 billion</a> to <a href='http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/06/9-future-of-iot-part-2' title='' rel=''>50 billion</a> connected objects by 2020 (depending on who you listen to). That’s a thrilling prospect. A world where our entire physical environment has the ability to exchange data with the internet and other connected objects. A world that’s more convenient, more streamlined, and more responsive to our needs. It’s also a terrifying prospect. A world of ubiquitous surveillance, a world where privacy is no longer a guaranteed right but instead a privilege you must fight for. The possibility of data breaches, backdoors into home systems, vehicles being hacked by shadowy forces, are very real</p>\n<p>Thinking about this in the right way is difficult, because every time we use that ridiculous term, “the Internet of Things” we distance ourselves from understanding how big the transformation really is. Sure, we need to give it a name. It’s a necessary evil. But in this case not only is the name silly, it’s misleading. Things? No. We’re really talking about the ubiquitous connection of everything, not just inanimate objects, but services, interactive devices, sensors and ultimately, people.</p>\n<p>When we’re thinking about the IoT (and yes, I’ll use the damn term) we should really be situating it within the larger context of a global technological flourishing that’s taking place all around us. We’re seeing simultaneous, once-in-a-hundred-years technology revolutions taking place in multiple sectors, from energy and transport to manufacturing, finance and healthcare. It’s the result of an inevitable technological push that’s going to drop humanity into a sea of meshed connections, with mind-blowing consequences.</p>\n<h4>Hardware is evolving</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>The IoT is a part of something much bigger, something you might call the hardware movement. As <a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/06/why-the-internet-of-things-isnt-the-same-as-the-new-hardware-movement.html' title='' rel=''>John Bruner points out</a>, this movement is making our physical environment accessible in the same way the internet made information and ease of communication accessible to everyone 20 years ago. It’s the democratization of the world of stuff, a flattening out of the manufacturing process that takes the means of production away from large, 20th century style organizations of scale and into the hands of smaller, distributed businesses and individuals</p>\n<p>Bruner says this has been aided in large part by the improvement of software, which allows us to solve many of the things that we used to do with hardware. It wasn’t too long ago that 3D modelling software was only accessible to large corporations and more recently, to smaller businesses. But now these powerful tools are in the hands of anyone with an internet connection and a computer. And of course not only is the software accessible, it’s accompanied by an online cornucopia of free instructions and videos on how to make just about anything.</p>\n<p>It’s not just about fancy computers and cheap, ubiquitous DIY either. It’s also about a change in the way we think stuff should be made. For most of the 20th century manufacturing was dominated by companies that were able to operate at scale. That’s still the case in much of the world. But at the innovative edges, technologies like additive manufacturing are <a href='https://medium.com/backchannel/how-one-australian-entrepreneur-is-about-to-disrupt-a-20-billion-industry-you-ve-never-heard-of-254afd0269e8' title='' rel=''>giving rise to a new type of enterprise</a>: high functioning, cooperative, point of service companies with fast reaction manufacturing capabilities. Hardware development is becoming an agile operation; smaller and quicker to get products into testing and out for distribution. This goes beyond electronics and touches any industry that produces physical goods</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum we get the maker movement, symptomatic of a more general trend of moving hardware innovation to the edges, to the hobbyists and entrepreneurs. The IoT comes somewhere in between big manufacturing on the one side and the maker movement on the other. And it’s possible not only because of incredible advances in our ability to make hardware, but also because of an exponential improvement in the effectiveness of communications technologies.</p>\n<p>We’re getting better at this stuff all the time. A few weeks ago for example, a company called Rockchip <a href='http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2411433/rockchip-shrinks-power-consumption-down-to-bluetooth-levels-for-iot-deployments' title='' rel='nofollow'>made a major leap forward</a> with WiFi technology, developing a a combined memory and WiFi system on a chip card that uses 85 percent less energy than standard products. In practical terms that means it’s now possible to create a cheap WiFi compatible object that can run off an AAA battery for 35 years. That’s something which hasn’t been possible until now. Bluetooth has that kind of energy efficiency but it’s an inferior technology compared to WiFi, which has a longer reach and is a standard form of communication in most products. As technologies like this become commonplace they’ll empower manufacturers by allowing them to use smaller batteries, which will help in the effort to make IoT products that people really need</p>\n<h4>Less of the same, more of the different</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Enterprise companies aren’t stupid. They know the IoT is coming and they’re trying to jump on the bandwagon because they’re scared of being disrupted/see there’s a great opportunity. A few, like Google and Samsung have managed to gain a foothold in this space already. However most companies haven’t got it right yet. The most high profile example of this is the Apple Watch. This is largely a design problem. In the technology industry, despite knowing better, we still tend to think that the next wave of innovation is going to look like the last one. We look at the personal computer and mobile phone revolutions, and think “well obviously what we need for the next tech revolution is smaller/better screens.”</p>\n<p>But we don’t need more screens. According to David Rose, an instructor at the MIT Media Lab, we’re seeing a cultural yearning to <em>solve</em> the issue of screens soaking up the majority of our attention. We’ve come to the end of that particular technology pathway. Instead, says Rose, the IoT is only going to work when we create <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com.au/enchanted-objects-by-david-rose-2014-8' title='' rel=''>objects that seem like magic</a>. The example he likes to use is Bilbo Baggins’ sword, <em>Sting, </em>a dual purpose object. The elves made it primarily to cut up their enemies, but Sting also glows blue when Orcs or Goblins are around. In other words it’s what he calls an “enchanted object.” A real-world version of that, according to Rose, would be an umbrella whose handle glows blue when snow or rain is coming. It’s also an enchanted object, but it doesn’t work through Elvish magic. It works because of a combination of LEDs, location tracking and an internet connection to a weather prediction service</p>\n<p>Design problems for the IoT also extend to how businesses think these new technologies should be deployed. Too often, they forget about the changes going on in sectors around them, but technological progress doesn’t take place in isolation. RFID tracking, for example, might seem like promising technology for large international shipping companies, because it means they can potentially create real-time digital maps of every product in their supply chain.</p>\n<p>Great news for the electronic consumer goods industry right? It means more efficiency for the company, and more control for customers who can track their products.</p>\n<p>The problem is that this thought process ignores the advent of additive manufacturing technologies which have the potential to strip out every node in that supply chain. Why bother tracking products all the way across the globe when in ten years time you’ll be going down to your local electronics store with a schematic you downloaded from an approved supplier, and get them to 3D print the product out for pickup the next day? That’s where the consumer goods industry is going. If you’re a logistics company, it means you’re better off worrying about what the IoT can do in the final mile (shop to home) than you are about the rest of the supply chain.</p>\n<h4>We need an IoT Bill of Rights</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>In discussions about the IoT we tend to focus on the technical first and then the economic and social. But there’s an ethical component to all of this, too, that centers around our philosophy and approach. To explain this, remember that the internet was founded by geeks. If you were online during the late 80s and early 90s for example, you’ll know that a popular destination was Usenet groups. Initially <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/ch106.x10' title='' rel=''>developed for chess games</a>, they came to be dominated by people talking about software, pornography or some variation of either D&D or sci-fi. I know. I was there. Possibly not the best place for an eight year old, but hey</p>\n<p>Content notwithstanding, these early, geeky pioneers had an amazing approach to working together. They founded the internet on the principle of open access and collaboration. It was intended to be a democratic tool, something to level the playing field. Of course governments and corporations have subsequently muscled into this territory as they now understand just how valuable information trails are. But by and large the original principles still hold true. The ongoing debates about net neutrality and whether or not broadband should be treated as a common carrier are emblematic of this. It’s the idea that one party doesn’t get to pay a higher price to send their information faster than any other party. The reason is because once we start having a tiered internet, we have a less open, less free and less democratic internet, and that’s not what its founders envisioned.</p>\n<p>We need similar kinds of principles laid down for the IoT. One idea, from technologist Limor Freid, <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/09/08/privacy-and-the-internet-of-things/a-bill-of-rights-for-the-internet-of-things' title='' rel=''>is that we create a minimal bill of rights</a>. Something that says open is better than closed, ensuring portability between devices. We must ensure that consumers, not companies, own the data collected by devices and that any devices that collect public data (such as traffic flows or crowd sizes) share that data in the public realm. Users should have the right to keep their data private, and be able to delete or back up data collected by the devices they own. We also need to ensure that individuals are compensated fairly for the information they create, rather than allowing the value to be skimmed off by what Jaron Lanier calls “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Owns_the_Future%3F' title='' rel=''>siren servers</a>,” which concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers</p>\n<p>Of course, this raises all sorts of questions, such as, “what’s the line between public and private data?” If I decide to meet, say, an ex-partner of mine in Federation Square in Melbourne, should that information be publicly recorded and accessible to my current partner on a public database, or is it something I’d prefer to keep to myself? These questions are important ones. Eventually we’ll all have to answer them in some form or another. We should be having serious discussions about these issues at the highest levels of policymaking, and yet all too often they’re buried in obscure online forums or niche communities of interest.</p>\n<p>So ignore the stories about fridges speaking to your phone, or smart forks that keep track of how fast you’re eating. Just because a device can be packed with sensors and put online, doesn’t mean it actually serves a consumer purpose. Those are products driven by marketing, and they distract us from the bigger issues at stake. Once connectivity is embedded within our physical environment the use cases will be far more interesting and transformative.</p>\n<p>Start thinking differently about the IoT. Make sure you place it within its larger technological context, and join the vanguard that’s establishing new design practices and principles for how we’re going to manage it. It’s not more of the same. It’s something new. And once we get past that stupid name, it’s going to change the world.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QXPFTt0jOZKk4eEiVci9cA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><em>This article is based on a talk delivered at the <a href='http://www.meetup.com/IoT-Melbourne/events/223253765/' title='' rel=''>IoT Meetup</a> in Melbourne, Australia on Wednesday 29th July.</em></p>\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>\n<p><strong>Is the IoT hype, a reason for hope, or a horrid siren call into a dystopia where <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/opinion/zeynep-tufekci-why-smart-objects-may-be-a-dumb-idea.html' title='' rel=''>everything is trackable and hackable</a>?

And that’s wrong.	2015-08-21 14:54:24	b90a36a03345	<h2>Cable-Only Presidential Debates are the New Poll Tax</h2>\n<h4>If you cut the cord, you just may cut yourself off from vital political discourse. And that’s wrong.</h4>\n\n<p>This month’s theatrical GOP primary debate was a watershed event: Gov. Kasich became a national figure, Megyn Kelly definitively exposed the misogyny of Mr. Trump (only to wind up in a spat with him), and Jeb Bush turned shy.</p>\n<p>But few remarked on what may be a more significant milestone: The Fox News debate marked the moment when politics became indistinguishable from sport in more than just entertainment value. Just as we can’t watch most sporting events (including large swathes of the Olympics) without a cable or satellite subscription, Americans couldn’t watch the debate online unless they were part of the cable/satellite ecosystem.</p>\n<p>As a matter of American history and civics, this should be shocking. But when I told a friend of mine that this bothered me, he said, snarkily, “Oh, right, because you can’t pay for cable. Of course you can. What’s your problem?”</p>\n<p>So it seems to me maybe a little re-education (or myth-busting) might be useful. There are all kinds of public values at stake here, and we shouldn’t glide past them. This is the place where the increasingly blurry public/private line should, for many people, stand out in sharp relief. There is no speech more central to civic life than a political debate. And yet we have allowed access to that speech by way of the common medium of our era — high-speed Internet access — to be controlled by a cabal of private actors.</p>\n<p>The thing is that Fox News Channel owes its existence — completely — to a federal statutory regime aimed at supporting the “public trustee” role of traditional TV broadcasters. And yet all the “public-ness” of that deal has been washed away: Fox News felt no need to ensure that online viewers could watch the debate. That meant that cord-cutters and cord-nevers — basically, Millennials and an ever-increasing chunk of Americans — whose high-speed Internet access wasn’t sold to them by a cable company had to wait for re-runs.</p>\n<p>Let me explain. The story starts in the mid-1980s with the cobbling together by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation of a bunch of independent broadcast TV stations and 20th Century Fox. The result: a fourth network, a competitor to CBS, ABC, and NBC, called the Fox Television Stations group. (For older people this history is unnecessary; few of my students, however, have heard of broadcast TV or know the difference between a cable channel and a broadcast television station). That network — using, by the way, spectrum licensed by the federal government — launched in October 1986 with The Late Show, hosted by the late Joan Rivers.</p>\n<p>Weird fact alert: The Fox television network differentiated itself by aiming its programming at a younger demographic — 18 to 49. <em>The Simpsons</em>. <em>Family Guy</em>. <em>Married, with Children.</em> It is this very demographic that isn’t part of the cable/satellite world and was more likely left out of the Fox News the-cable-channel debate audience last week</p>\n<p>End of digression. In exchange for their rights to use spectrum, Fox and the other broadcasters agreed to some regulatory obligations as the nation’s common medium of communication. The idea was, and in theory still is, that these broadcasters serve as “public trustees.”</p>\n<p>With the rise of cable distribution of television broadcasts in the 1970s and 1980s — distribution by way of wires rather than over the air — the public and legislators became increasingly worried that the cable industry was going to dominate the delivery of information and entertainment into American households. And so, in 1992, Congress passed a Cable Act that was aimed at making it possible for satellite delivery of television programming to be a viable competitor to cable.</p>\n<p>In order to get the broadcasters — Fox and its brethren — on board, Congress gave them the right to demand payment from cable and satellite companies for access to broadcast signals. This scheme, called “retransmission consent,” made the broadcasters very happy: in addition to selling ads, they could get cash from distributors. Two streams of revenue!</p>\n<p>The problem was, initially, that the cable guys (in particular) had no interest in sending cash to broadcasters. John Malone, then head of cable giant TCI, now the guy behind the upcoming Charter/Time Warner Cable/Bright House mega-merger, growled that he wasn’t paying a cent; “I don’t intend to pay any money,” he said. “I will scratch backs.” All the cable operators followed suit in refusing to pay for retransmission consent. As a result, broadcasters that chose retransmission consent received no cash; they got, instead, permission to distribute additional new cable channels.</p>\n<p>And that’s how Fox News Channel came into being in 1996. Instead of cash, Murdoch got distribution of another channel. He hired Roger Ailes, and we got <em>The O’Reilly Factor </em>and last week’s debate</p>\n<p>It was an extraordinarily interesting debate, but it wasn’t for everyone, apparently. Fox News locked it down.</p>\n<p>The legend on the Fox News site that evening read:</p>\n<><strong><em>Watch the Fox News/Facebook debate on your mobile device</strong></em></>\n<><strong><em>CLICK THE VIDEO TO LOGIN WITH YOUR CABLE PROVIDER</strong></em></>\n<p>You’d think that, considering how important this debate was, Fox News would livestream it online for everyone. But Fox News has no regulatory obligation to do so.</p>\n<p>No federal government, no spectrum license. No spectrum license, no broadcast rights. No broadcast rights, no cudgel to force distribution of Fox News. And, yet, the public interest in wide distribution of debates online hasn’t filtered down to Fox News. For them, this is just another sporting event.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Maybe people found the debate online via illegal streams.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the big story behind this. The linear — traditional — model of TV is crumbling, slowly, as more people find programming they’re happy with online. But sports programming remains the Gibraltar of the pay TV bundle: the bedrock, the real-time, must-have stuff that Americans will still pay for. And so pay TV executives, looking to smooth the obvious glide path sloping towards the irrelevance of thick bundles of TV-plus-data <em>just long enough</em> so their retirements will be secure and well-funded, want to turn new categories of programming into sports. Presto: debates become sports, unavailable in livestream form to anyone who doesn’t have a cable or satellite subscription</p>\n<p>This is a bad idea. It’s insulting to the thicket of public values that gave this industry life in the first place. It’s wrong. And it shouldn’t happen again in this presidential season. Surely some pay TV guy or gal, somewhere, knows in his or her flinty, close-to-retirement heart of hearts that this practice must not continue. Let’s hope.</p>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>	2015-08-28 03:00:36.142932	2015-09-24 01:00:52.221843	<h2>Cable-Only Presidential Debates are the New Poll Tax</h2>\n<h4>If you cut the cord, you just may cut yourself off from vital political discourse.

114	6	5 Hypotheses about the Future of the Humanities	Some stray thoughts predicting where the Humanities will go.	2015-08-01 06:41:02	9efdb2fc77db	<p></p>\n<p>Some stray thoughts predicting where the Humanities will go.</p>\n<p>1.\n<strong>Disciplines will become clustered around subject areas rather than methods for creating knowledge.</strong></p>\n<p>Fun fact: in November 2013, the president of the long-standing American Philological Association announced that the APA would be permanently changing its name to the “Society for Classical Studies.” This decision reflects the fact that while the APA was founded in 1869 by scholars studying many ancient and modern languages — ancient Greek, middle English, contemporary German — other academic disciplines gradually splintered off, forming new bodies like the Modern Language Association (1883), the biggest association for English departments, and the Linguistic Society of America (1924). The Society for Classical Studies is composed of experts in Greek, Latin, and the material history of the ancient Mediterranean; their research is explicitly interdisciplinary in approach.</p>\n<p>This change, while seemingly minor, points out a growing trend in the Humanities: instead of departments being organized by their strategies and methods for creating knowledge, they will cluster around loose subject areas with more popular appeal.</p>\n<p>2.\n<strong>Humanities disciplines will orient toward solving problems instead of uncovering them</strong></p>\n<p>When I started graduate school, I was told by a professor that while acts of interpretation — which English departments train students rigorously to do through different theoretical lenses — happens everywhere,</p>\n<>“academia is the only place where people are paid\nto create problems through interpretation.”</>\n<p>Because of the changing commitments of universities and both internal and external market pressures (which have been written and debated about at such length that I won’t repeat here), this model of the Humanities department as a protected place (insulating scholars from the demands of time) to uncover and tease out nonobvious problems is simply not sustainable. Instead, the Humanities will have to prove their value to the university through their ability to point to solutions.</p>\n<p>3.\n<strong>The Humanities will lose even more clout within universities.</strong></p>\n<p>For years now, the Humanities have been shifting away from being “talent” in the corporate university model. This trend will continue, and disciplines will go from not just being thought of as low-level teaching bodies, but to actually being the “support” for other disciplines. For example, some disciplines will become resource-builders for more highly valued disciplines. (See below.)</p>\n<p>4.\n<strong>Disciplines will be less critically-oriented.</strong></p>\n<p>While the following is a fine-art discipline example rather than a Humanities one, the recent “USC 7” story offers an illustration of what I mean by critical vs. non-critical orientation.</p>\n<>Last spring, all 7 MFA students dropped out of USC’s Masters in Fine Arts program in visual art.</>\n<p>The new dean of the program was clearly leaching support out of this critically-oriented program in order to devote resources to a new art, technology, and business program co-founded by Dr. Dre and an entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>Yes, this is an example of the private sector taking over particular disciplines that are seen as partly profitable — but that’s not the interesting part, which is what drops out when you leave the traditional MFA training behind. While both these programs focus on creativity and aesthetics, only one values the outlook that trains students to question and challenge their own education — not to mention the teaching apparatus itself.</p>\n<p>We’re going to see a lot more of this displacement of traditional Humanities departments focused on critical thinking with new programs that cherry-pick certain concepts and repackage them in a watered-down entrepreneurial message.</p>\n<p>5.\n<strong>The Humanities will be seen as a historical movement with a historical ending: both as a field of knowledge and as a profession.</strong></p>\n<p>When the Humanities are no longer offered protection from market pressures, they will not survive in any recognizable form. The modes of knowledge produced by the Humanities will be preserved, but without a professional home for future Humanities work.</p>\n<>They will become historical archives.</>	2015-08-01 07:00:58.302317	2015-08-01 07:00:58.302317	<p></p>\n<p>Some stray thoughts predicting where the Humanities will go.</p>\n<p>1.\n<strong>Disciplines will become clustered around subject areas rather than methods for creating knowledge.</strong></p>\n<p>Fun fact: in November 2013, the president of the long-standing American Philological Association announced that the APA…</p>
77	6	Getting Evaluations Right	5 ways grantees can get better at getting better	2015-07-20 02:29:00	6ab721c75368	<h3>Getting Evaluations Right</h3>\n<h4>5 ways grantees can get better at getting better</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Philanthropy has come a long way in evaluating and reporting on whether funded projects are working. Instead of furtively redirecting underperforming grants or attempting to shine up less-than-stellar results for an annual report, foundations are doing one better: learning to get better at getting better.</p>\n<p>When well designed and implemented, evaluations can provide useful information and insights that drive strategy and impact. The key is providing grantees feedback in ways they can use to learn what’s working (or not) and act on that information to continuously improve. Five lessons are emerging:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Shorter feedback loops</strong></p>\n<p>When grantees receive evaluation feedback early and more often, they can make the changes necessary to deliver better results.</p>\n<p>The <a href='https://doceo.nnu.edu/about' title='' rel=''>Doceō project</a>, launched by the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation (JKAF), established technology education centers at Northwest Nazarene University and the University of Idaho. The goal of the center is to help student teachers and in-service teachers use technology to engage students in deeper, more relevant learning</p>\n<p>To ensure only the best, most effective ideas make it to the classroom, they incorporated a “skunk works” lab to test ideas with rapid feedback loops and a flexible, iterative design to fine tune and make them “student ready.”</p>\n<p>Shorter feedback loops allow grantees to avert failure and build on success more quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Quantitative and qualitative data</strong></p>\n<p>The best evaluations use more than one way of knowing to clarify the results picture and deepen understanding.</p>\n<p>JKAF uses structured reports that capture what was done and the impact of the activities, as well as changes made as a result of lessons learned. The work to document the <a href='https://doceo.nnu.edu/about' title='' rel=''>Doceō project</a>’s efforts and outcomes (both quantitative and qualitative) encourages reflection by the grantees and challenges them to continuously look for ways to improve results. The project is only a few years old and is now honing more ways to quantify outcomes</p>\n<p>JKAF and many others may benefit from a look at the <a href='https://www.irvine.org/youth/linked-learning' title='' rel=''>James Irvine Foundation’s Linked Learning</a> data system, which allows grantees to drill down and assess progress and compare populations on a range of metrics. This is coupled with a broader evaluation that provides qualitative information behind the numbers to tell an instructive story about the data</p>\n<p><strong>3. Leading indicators</strong></p>\n<p>Too often the success or failure of education is measured <em>after </em>the fact. Education reporting and data-collection systems almost exclusively focus on metrics like graduation rates, test scores, and even employment, which are reported too late to be acted upon. While important and representative of goals we as a nation must attain, they are not designed to help those in the delivery of education do the work required to meet those goals. By shifting the <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-c-phillips/driving-education-accountability_b_6927890.html' title='' rel=''>focus from lagging to leading indicators</a>, educators can better respond to students’ needs in time to make a difference</p>\n<p>Looking upstream after establishing intended outcomes for funding will reveal leading indicators that provide early warning signals for projects not headed in the right direction. Tracking graduation rates is an important indicator of success, but this lagging indicator provides no room for improvement — or indication of where to improve — if projects are not meeting their targets. Leading indicators, such as attendance, course success, and math progression rates, to name a few, can provide early warning in time for action and direct stakeholders to where and who needs attention. Much of the criticism of philanthropy’s education work focuses on failures of implementation. However, with indicators available to identify these failures early enough to fix them, everything changes.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Visualize and make data actionable</strong></p>\n<p>Organizations can be datapaloozas — like the Robin Hood Foundation, which evaluate grants using <a href='https://www.robinhood.org/metrics' title='' rel=''>163 different formulas</a> and reports the results with graphics that tell a story</p>\n<p>The holy grail of evaluation is taking data out of its fields and putting it to work on behalf of grantees. Dashboards and interactive visualization tools are useful in helping grantees peel back layers to compare populations, reveal disparities and areas of progress as well as need.</p>\n<p>For example, NPR used data from Achieve and the NCES Common Core of Data to create <a href='http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/06/04/412093161/the-truth-behind-your-states-high-school-grad-rate' title='' rel=''>a searchable database and graphics t</a>hat help bring to life a complicated truth about graduation rates. This kind of reporting and presentation provokes interest in the why and for whom</p>\n<p>Routine collaboration around data creates a culture of reflection on what has been accomplished (and what has not). This is the hallmark of learning organizations committed to continuous improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Open source what works and doesn’t</strong></p>\n<p>In February, billionaire Eli Broad announced the <a href='http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-broad-prize-20150209-story.html' title='' rel=''>suspension of his foundation’s $1 million prize</a> given to the best urban school systems out of concern that schools are not improving fast enough.

This could be an innovative way to address the systemic issues the Broad Academy outlined in a recent <a href='https://medium.com/education-reform/what-does-it-take-to-be-an-urban-schools-superintendent-a-whole-lot-more-than-you-think-1815620d9432' title='' rel=''>Medium post</a>.

What…	2015-07-03 19:12:43	3fdd1534f257	<h3>Code like a Girl, dress any way you want</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think one of the issues of getting girls into Computer Science and other STEM areas is the idea that you have to be nerdy to do it. What I have learned is this is not true.</p>\n<p>In my early years in tech, I wanted to be one of the guys. I would try not to show off my feminine side. What if I got caught, what if they found out I was a girly girly?!</p>\n<p>Over time I realized this did more harm than good. This reinforced the stereotypes that girly girls can’t code, or be competent in tech. What it was really saying was “women can do this, but only if they acted like men”. This is bad both for men and women.</p>\n<p>If men believe this they won’t hire women unless they look the part, they will think they won’t fit into their culture. I in fact heard a friend tell me recently that someone she knows did not hire a very good women developer as he was worried she wouldn’t fit in. Would she have been hired if she showed up in comic t-shirts, jeans, and talked about video games? This has to change.</p>\n<p>The idea that you have to act like a guy to work in tech will also stop other women who might consider it. They may have no interest in giving up their clothes, and interests and friends just because they think they might like coding. That creates a huge barrier to getting more girls and women into tech. This is so wrong and I didn’t want to keep reinforcing this.</p>\n<p>Now I am just myself. Take it or leave it. I am awesome at my job, I love tech, I am sometimes girly, I am sometimes super geeky, but I am always myself. But it took me awhile to get there.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*pVoesfgX85jHxwMoI2m58Q.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Doing a science experiment wearing her mini mouse dress.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>It is very important to me that my daughter and other girls also knows this. My daughter loves princesses and her collection of princess dresses. She also loves her dinosaur stuffy she bought with her own money, going to science camps, playing scientist with her science kit, playing lego, playing dollies, animals, painting her nails, wearing sparkle shoes, wearing blue and green over pink, wearing sweat pants, and playing princess.</p>\n<p>I want her to grow up in a world where it is ok for her to do every girl stereotype AND anything else she chooses. I don't want her to think she has to be a tomboy to be interested in STEM and hide her girlyness. I want her to just be herself and be empowered to do what her heart desires.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/1*hI81gbJeJYngY4_RN_fzcQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Gardening with Dad in sweats</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I love that she dresses in sweats and her soccer camp t-shirt one day and the next she is in a ballerina skirt with pink top and pink leggings, sparkle shoes, and tiara the next. Just because they are girly it should not preclude them from liking diansaours, science, or sports.</p>\n<p>Let’s make the conversation for our young girls about the possibilities of what they can do with their lives, and not about how they have to dress to do it.

I know that when I feel this way, I sure can get a lot done, more than I thought…	2015-07-15 17:03:38	9794b9b33fba	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/800/1*t3lT_RcTsGnq05zFTOovWg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Ever feel totally empowered? Like you could do anything? I know that when I feel this way, I sure can get a lot done, more than I thought was possible when I began.</p>\n<p>When I’m not empowered?</p>\n<p>I’m disengaged from the task or problem that I’m working on. Now this happens for a number of reasons — I’m tired, I don’t feel well, I’m confused and don’t understand what I’m suppose to really do. However, when I was a teacher, one of the biggest reasons: I knew that whatever I suggested would go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>I remember when we were asked as a staff by our principal to come up with a different supervision format since many of us were dissatisfied with the current system. We had morning meetings, did brainstorming and came up with several different options which we presented to the staff only to have the principal make a suggestion and then go with that suggestion. Totally disempowered! Total waste of time. Disengaged.</p>\n<p><strong>Disengaged to empowered</strong></p>\n<p>My<a href='http://kellychristopherson.ca/wp/archives/2369' title='' rel=''> recent post dealt</a> with disengagement. One of the<a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/gallup-education-report_n_5119966.html' title='' rel=''> stats that I found stated that 70% of teachers repor</a>t being disengaged at work. As I thought about this and wondered why teachers are disengaged? I reflected that maybe it wasn’t that they were disengaged but feeling undervalued as professionals, and like our group, were not being given the opportunity to lead and use our talents. As Liz Wiseman says in <a href='http://www.amazon.ca/The-Multiplier-Effect-Tapping-Schools/dp/1452271895/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_y' title='' rel=''>The Multiplier Effect — Tapping the Genius Inside Our Schools</a></p>\n<><em>Multipliers know how to find this dormant intelligence, challenge it, and put is to use at its fullest. …. They are genius makers. They know that at the apex of the intelligence hierarchy is not the lone genius but rather the smart leader who also brings out smarts and capability in everyone around him or her.</em></>\n<p>Too often teachers are told what they need to do, what they need to teach, how they need to teach it. People visit their rooms and critique their performance. That’s part of the problem, it’s seen as a performance. Yet most teachers I know see teaching as their calling, it’s their vocation in the traditional sense of the word.</p>\n<p><a href='http://goinswriter.com/about-me/' title='' rel=''>Jeff Goins</a> in his book <a href='http://www.amazon.ca/Art-Work-Proven-Discovering-Meant-ebook/dp/B00PWOHB1U/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1436906701&sr=1-1&keywords=The+ARt+of+Work' title='' rel=''>The Art of Work</a> explores people finding their calling — finding their place. If you listen to teachers, you soon get that they were meant to be in the classroom with children. They’re calling is to help students. However, in an attempt to make schooling more efficient and learning more standardized, teachers are being left out of the learning discussions more and more</p>\n<p><strong>Empower the Teachers</strong></p>\n<p>So, how can an administrator shift this to empower teachers within the school? Below I present five ideas that might help empower educators which, in turn will help them to feel engaged in the work they are doing.</p>\n<p>1. <em>Provide each teacher with a reading budget.</em> Each month. Encourage teachers to read. Share what you are reading. Exploring beyond the traditional educational reading is good — and have them share — each month at a staff meeting — in groups do a book sharing</p>\n<p>2. <em>Have TEDstyle talks every month.</em> Each month have teachers give a TEDtalk about something they are doing in their classroom or something they are learning about. Don’t know what at TED talk looks like, <a href='https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-talks-education' title='' rel=''>check it out here</a>.

Have each teacher share with other teachers about something that really resonated with them. Again, this can be done at a staff meeting in groups. Don’t know where to start with blog posts? Here are a few suggestions to get started</p>\n<p><a href='http://teach.com/teach100' title='' rel=''>Teach 100</a> — a list of international educational blogs.

Find time to have teachers observe other teachers. As an administrator I had the privilege of visiting many classrooms and my own teaching improved because I was able to learn from the teachers. Why not allow teachers to learn from one another through observing each other teach? Start out in your own building but see if there are other schools interested in sharing and co-operating to do this</p>\n<p>5. <em>Have teachers lead staff meetings and other presentations.</em> Have teachers talk about the successes and growth that is happening at the school. Give them opportunity to lead by supporting their ideas and letting them lead projects and groups. Don’t just leave this for those who volunteer. “I’m not very good at…….” is <a href='http://kellychristopherson.ca/wp/archives/2351' title='' rel=''>an invitation </a>for you to support. “What is holding you back from being successful?” will show that you are interested in them being successful</p>\n<p>I don’t think any of these are difficult to do but I do think that each of these will help to empower teachers as professionals. I wouldn’t suggest doing them all at once! I would also suggest that, as an administrator, you lead by example in doing these — give a TEDsyle talk, share your own blog or blogs you read. Also, give teachers the gift of time to do these — teach their class once or twice before they give their talk, find ways so they can visit other classrooms, nudge them to lead the staff meeting or presentation and help them prepare for it. If we are truly concerned about the level of student engagement then being concerned about teacher engagement should also be a priority. Rather than engaging teachers in specific agendas, empower them to be leaders, using their talents and abilities to share and grow together with other teachers.</p>	2015-07-20 03:01:10.849354	2015-07-26 01:01:13.375015	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/800/1*t3lT_RcTsGnq05zFTOovWg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Ever feel totally empowered?

From employing learning center staff to figuring out what technology…	2015-07-15 15:10:20	3fe255e1cd02	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*o_VL6Y0Dr8iW2aiEZCkbOA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>It can be easy to get lost in the fog of providing student support. From employing learning center staff to figuring out what technology needs to be used where, sometimes the student is forgotten. Student support is, after all, all about helping the student achieve his or her goals.</p>\n<p>Student services, when done right, can be beneficial to both the student and the school. Successful services will support the student in his or her classes, and eventually improve retention rates. There are a few ways to make sure that your solutions are still on the right track.</p>\n<h4>Services should be easy to use</h4>\n<p>One of the fundamental rules of User Experience design is that the easier it is to do something, the more people will do it. This principle applies to more than just creating interfaces. Even small details can make a difference in determining whether a student will use an available service.</p>\n<p>For example, being as clear as possible when it comes to how your Learning Center works can be crucial. To an administator, the Learning Center makes perfect sense. You know the hours it’s open, where it is, how to schedule a new appointment, and how to prepare for an appointment. But that doesn’t mean students will know all that. Students who understand how your services work are more likely to use them.</p>\n<p>Usability is especially important when it comes to tech-based services accessed through a computer. Though we may see college students as tech-savvy, there are some who have difficulties using new tech. Try to keep all students in mind when building or purchasing new tech solutions.</p>\n<p>While tech-based solutions have the advantage of being able to scale at a lower price, they can also lack human touch. Without a person to guide the student, usability is crucial to increasing usage of these resources. Students who get frustrated won’t always contact support and may just end up giving up.</p>\n<h4>Services should appeal to students</h4>\n<p>One aspect that administrators are quick to forget is whether students will <em>want</em> to use their services. Your support resources have to compete with companies like <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/' title='' rel=''>Khan Academy</a> and <a href='http://www.heynightowl.com/' title='' rel=''>Night Owl</a>. These services have teams of people dedicated to marketing and improving their products. But, schools can offer things that 3rd party services can’t. Only schools can provide on campus availability and official support of services. Use those advantages</p>\n<p>School administrators should focus on solving a problem that either doesn’t have a solution yet, or has a poor one in place. Many schools we work with have online tutoring systems in place, but don’t have a way for students to access on-campus tutors online. Schools who implement our system (<a href='https://upswing.io/solutions/tutorup/' title='' rel=''>TutorUp</a>) improve their service by granting access to on-campus resources online. This is a service that can’t exist without the school’s support and<strong> </strong>is also appealing to students</p>\n<h4>Students should know about available services</h4>\n<p>You can have easy to use, useful services set up for your students, but still have no users. “If you build it, they will come” isn’t always true. It’s important to find ways to market services to students, but it isn’t easy. You have to craft a message that shows the student that there is a service that they 1) should use, 2) can enjoy, and 3) can easily access.</p>\n<p>One of the easiest and most common ways to promote student services is with flyers. Once designed, flyers can be mass produced at a low price and placed all around the school. Flyers are a good place to start, but there are ways to go above and beyond. One method we use to promote Upswing on campus is with our Campus Ambassador program. First, we find the most active student leaders on-campus by asking around. Then, we work with these students to promote <a href='https://upswing.io/' title='' rel=''>Upswing</a> to the student body. We’ve seen success at getting students to start using our platform using this approach</p>\n<h4>Focusing on the student</h4>\n<p>Creating easy to use, appealing, and popular services boils down to putting the student first. As more students use the services available to them, more students will feel supported. Students who feel supported by their school are more likely to do well in classes and graduate. By offering services that students want to use, you can see a large return on investment from your support services.</p>\n<p><a href='https://upswing.io' title='' rel=''><em>Upswing</a> is a higher education retention company that focuses on online tutoring and providing advanced analytics.

76	6	Last Class — Despairing Rant Against Test-based Curricula	On the first anniversary of my last day teaching,	2015-07-21 22:54:27	6e12e56555a2	<p></p>\n<h4>On the first anniversary of my last day teaching,</h4>\n<h4>July 17, 2014</h4>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*TkjhXs4ap4k6sdYrGkMRiw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Intro to Lit is over and my teaching career is over, too. It seems very anti-climactic to me that my 35 years teaching ended not with a bang, but a whimper. 20 grocery store cupcakes and a packet of napkins. On the other hand, a Bang can be a gun or a bomb and that would be worse than sharing cupcakes and sending everyone home after 30 minutes because the movie I’d planned to show (no, not <em>Stand and Deliver</em>) wouldn’t play because I did not have permission to install Silverlight on the college computer. $10 down the drain, but now I can watch Sidney Poitier in <em>Raisin in the Sun</em> any time I want. That has been exactly once in my life… so… I wanted out of there, anyway. That never happened before, but I knew I was done</p>\n<p>The parade of sad ignorance lasted until the end. We read poetry by Langston Hughes (“A Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Harlem”) and once again the basic historical background was lacking for them to get the jist of the poems. If this were high school, I’d figure on teaching that first, but at college? They all know that Martin Luther King was a great man, but I learned yesterday that they do not really know why. They did not know of the riots and the deaths around the Civil Rights Amendment. They did not know that white supporters of Black rights were killed alongside their Black brothers. In their minds it was ALL the Blacks vs. ALL the Whites.They did not know about the burning of Watts or the “pray in” in Selma or the murderous demonstrations on the streets of Harlem where blacks and whites marched and died.</p>\n<p>— — — — — — —</p>\n<p>I wrote a worksheet they would be able to do for extra points. One of the questions asked about the significance of the rivers Hughes mentions in his poem. Several of my students had no idea where these rivers are — the Congo, the Nile, the Euphrates. Thankfully, they were OK with the Mississippi.</p>\n<p><strong>The Negro Speaks of Rivers </strong>By Langston Hughe</p>\n<p>I’ve known rivers:</p>\n<p>I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.</p>\n<p>My soul has grown deep like the rivers.</p>\n<p>I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.</p>\n<p>I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.</p>\n<p>I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.</p>\n<p>I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.</p>\n<p>I’ve known rivers:</p>\n<p>Ancient, dusky rivers.</p>\n<p>My soul has grown deep like the rivers.</p>\n<p>Another absolutely dispiriting experience except for the fact that some (five) of the students are happy to be learning. Since that’s the whole point of teaching, I left the class with my spirit lifted slightly that at least by 5 pm, the Iraqi girl knew that the Euphrates runs through her native land and it is the cradle of civilization.</p>\n<p>— — — — — — —</p>\n<p>The worksheet also asked them how the poem “Harlem” was prophetic and asked if it was a warning or a call to action. Warning of what? Call to what action? When I brought up the question for oral discussion, my students looked at me as if I’d asked something completely impossible. We’d spent time on the history of blacks in the US from WW I on. The students had SOME context, but I realized that I was wrong in assuming they’d learned about American history of the 50s and 60s in their relentless diversity training.</p>\n<p><strong>Harlem</strong> by Langston Hughe</p>\n<p>What happens to a dream deferred?</p>\n<p>Does it dry up</p>\n<p>like a raisin in the sun?</p>\n<p>Or fester like a sore —</p>\n<p>And then run?</p>\n<p>Does it stink like rotten meat?</p>\n<p>Or crust and sugar over —</p>\n<p>like a syrupy sweet?</p>\n<p>Maybe it just sags</p>\n<p>like a heavy load.</p>\n<p><em>Or does it explode?</em></p>\n<p>Because of this poem I’d planned to show them <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em> on the last day. That didn’t happen. It’s just as well</p>\n<p>— — — — — — —</p>\n<p>Any of you who read this who are public school teachers, I’ll be straight with you. I lay this at the doorstep of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and now Common Core. I know teachers are somewhat forced to teach what and how they do. I know their lives are assessment and evaluation driven. But this is creating a nation of ignorant people who mistake a quick answer from Wikipedia accessed on their cell phone for knowledge.</p>\n<p>I don’t know who but teachers themselves can stop this. Who else can? Parents? I think parents are as test and evaluation driven as our school systems and I know that parents are more (irritatingly) involved in their kid’s school life than ever. To what purpose? I, too, have been descended upon by helicopter parents who think interfering with the work of the teacher is OK. It’s not OK. Teachers are already trapped between districts and administrations with certain demands and students who need to learn.</p>\n<p>Teaching must be a horrible job, these days, because of these pressures.</p>\n<h4>Or are our teachers, too, so poorly educated and so ignorant that this is actually the BEST they can do?</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>I’m seriously asking. I know at the university where I have taught for 15 years, the GPA needed to get into Liberal Studies (teaching) is very low; a C. It’s well known that the lower paying professions do NOT attract the most intelligent students. This has gone on for a while, that teaching has paid poorly. Has it evolved to a situation in which very ignorant people of average or below average intelligence are now teachers? Has the politicization of education exacerbated this? I seriously want to know; are teachers today even intelligent enough to challenge our most intelligent students?</p>\n<h4>Or is there validity to NCLB BECAUSE our teachers are just not very good?</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Are parents interfering because they must? In my soul I cannot believe this, but more and more I’ve been wondering what’s actually been going on. My summer class truly frightened me.</p>\n<p>— — — —</p>\n<p>I have been giving my books to my students over this last week. Today I decided to give the three books I’ve kept from my senior English class in high school to a student who wants to be a high school English teacher. She did not show up for class today, but she could not manage those books, anyway. They are three tragedies by Sophocles,<em> </em>Aristotle’s <em>Poetics, </em>and Edith Hamilton’s <em>Greek Mythology. </em>Those were <em>my</em> high school texts — Advanced Placement English, true but that’s supposed to be college freshman English, a class this girl has passed or she would not be in this summer lit class</p>\n<p>I’ve watched the tide of ignorance engulf my students in the past ten years. I can almost pinpoint a year — sometime in 2009 my students (university level) were no longer able to identify facts in a business problem that involved prices on merchandise. The prices would be facts (just one example). “How do you know that’s a fact, Professor? Isn’t it all subjective?”</p>\n<p>“Sure it’s subjective if you can prove to me that when you go into a store you can choose any price you want to pay for a shirt, then the price is subjective. So IS it?”</p>\n<p>“Why are you tricking us? We want As!”</p>\n<p>That’s been my life for the past 7 or 8 years, worse and worse each year.</p>\n<p>As a teacher I believe in the John Dewey idea of meeting a student as his/her point of need. That’s usually been a pretty reasonable point. It also establishes my job description for a class. “Where are they NOW? What do they need to get HERE by the end of the semester?” That has always been my map. Find that the first week or two of class and then bring them along, whatever it takes, to the place they need to be. As NCLB has become more pervasive (longer in a student’s academic life) I have had to take them farther and farther along a road that interests them less and less. Why? Because any test-focused curriculum is BORING — mechanical, rote and mind numbing; I’ve had students say to me, “This is the first time I have liked school.” I’ve had students write, “Thank you for changing me.”</p>\n<h4>The current educational system has forgotten that a fundamental human <strong>joy</strong> is learning</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>We love it. It is in our biological imperative to learn, discover, try, test, question; it is our nature. Few of my students feel joy — that is something I also have had to teach them — so they can be excited by a challenge, thrilled by a discovery, moved by ideas, touched by beauty. No test-based curriculum can do ANY of that. It seems to me that our current school system is stealing from our young people a vital element of their humanity.</p>\n<p><a href='https://youtu.be/2Oo8QzDHimQ' title='' rel=''>Well, this is my song now</a></p>\n<p><em>Originally published at <a href='https://marthakennedy.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/last-class-despairing-rant-against-test-based-curricula/' title='' rel=''>marthakennedy.wordpress.com</a> on July 18, 2014.</em></p>	2015-07-20 03:01:08.078119	2015-07-27 15:01:41.418921	<p></p>\n<h4>On the first anniversary of my last day teaching,</h4>\n<h4>July 17, 2014</h4>
74	6	Let’s Talk about the Learning ….. not the grading	Toss the grades.	2015-07-20 02:30:15	4ed314a4604c	<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*BdkB_xgID4Zfrf1v.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Toss the grades.</p>\n<p>Get rid of grades.</p>\n<p>Learners don’t need grades.</p>\n<p>Throw out grades.</p>\n<p>Over the past few weeks these statements have flittered across my twitter feed.</p>\n<p>Many teachers I know are shifting and changing how assessment is done in their classroom. Many teachers I have worked with have already made this shift and are moving on. Although it may be something that isn’t common, it definitely isn’t new.</p>\n<p><strong>Fixing Grading</strong></p>\n<p>Ten years ago now, the school division I was working in began to move away from letter, percentage and other similar forms of grading in K — 8. Ken O’Connor’s book <a href='http://www.amazon.ca/Repair-Kit-Grading-Fifteen-Edition/dp/0132488639' title='' rel=''>A Repair Kit: 15 Fixes for Broken Grades </a>began a conversation about changing grading practices. Removing zeroes from assessment, allowing for flexible deadlines, creating rubrics and exemplars for students, providing formative assessment throughout the learning experience, Student Led Conferences, digital learning portfolios and online reporting were some of the shifts that took place as teachers moved away from traditional grades. It didn’t mean tossing report cards or jettisoning the use of tests but it did mean that teachers had to shift away from traditional grading practices, alter their assessment practices and shift away from testing</p>\n<p>Along the way, some teachers resisted, arguing that grades provided rigour and zeroes were a necessary as an incentive for students who didn’t hand in work. They resisted adopting a different mindset. Parents and students were also resistant — this wasn’t part of their worldview of school and learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Resistance Is Futile</strong></p>\n<p>Over time, those teachers who were resistant began to make changes to their assessment practices by changing their teaching practices and adopting such practices as peer feedback, self & peer assessment, formative assessment, and continuous feedback. This became the standard mode of operation as teachers shifted their teaching practices and restructured their planning. This happened through supporting and encouraging teachers through various PD experiences including division-wide inservice, conferences and developing PLC’s in schools. School leadership was a vital component of making a shift and helping to develop new cultures of learning in schools.</p>\n<p>As a teacher, I have given very few tests over the past 15 years. My classes were project/inquiry based with a minimal amount of lecturing. Final grades were a combination of student/teacher input in senior classes while any middle years classes used a totally different approach to reporting on outcomes. This was not unusual for many teachers I have known who began to shift and integrate technology in the classroom, adopting</p>\n<p>As an administrator, providing teachers with the necessary supports so they could transition from the traditional system was important because my own transition was supported through my own PD and learning. In the past 10 years I have worked in two schools were there were no letter/percentage grades in the K — 8. In grades 9–12 percentages were still provided at the end of the semester as they are required but assessment and reporting practices shifted to adopt continuous feedback throughout the learning experience. Project Based Learning and Inquiry were used by many teachers with formative assessment being provided on a continuous basis. Rubrics and feedback were used in all grades as was the use of digital portfolios. But assessment was not the focus — learning was.</p>\n<p><strong>The Future Has Arrived</strong></p>\n<p>For many teachers I work with, the <a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorrison/2015/02/28/throwing-out-grades-is-good-for-learning/' title='' rel=''>shift away from traditional</a> assessment began years ago. Students and parents have access to online information about student progress, online portfolios are shared with parents with regular updates of student work — they are developing a Portfolio Lifestyle as outlined by <a href='http://goinswriter.com/blog/' title='' rel=''>Jeff Goin</a> — discussions about learning focus on growth and development not on grades. Student Led Conferences and Celebrations of Learning are opportunities for students to share their learning. Conversations revolve around improvement, learning from mistakes, support and growth. Marks are only discussed because of the need to provide them for reporting in grades 9–12. Formative assessment is part of every classroom with teachers using various tools to develop and improve the feedback and discussion that they are having with students</p>\n<p>This isn’t something to look forward to because it’s already been done — across whole divisions — successfully. The grading practices have shifted from the “test for mark” system to continuous feedback where formative assessment is incorporated into the planning, continuous access to growth is provided parents through online portals and portfolios, and testing is not the norm. Granted it’s not everywhere but it isn’t just a few random teachers who are trying to make change — it’s what all teachers are expected.</p>\n<p>In making this shift, the discussion about education needed to change. Trying to convince people to change their worldview about grades and grading is very hard if that is where you begin the discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>Reward Risk-taking Not Failure</strong></p>\n<p>In the podcast the <a href='http://www.accidentalcreative.com/' title='' rel=''>Accidental Creative</a>, <a href='http://www.toddhenry.com/' title='' rel=''>Todd Henry</a> explores how creativity can be developed and cultivated. In his <a href='http://www.accidentalcreative.com/podcasts/ac/podcast-ron-friedman-on-the-best-places-to-work/' title='' rel=''>recent interview with Ron Friedman</a>, they discuss his latest book <a href='http://www.amazon.ca/Best-Place-Work-Extraordinary-Workplace-ebook/dp/B00INIYFTS/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=' title='' rel=''>The Best Place to Work</a>. One of things that really struck me was the idea that many people and companies say they want people to be risk-takers and innovative yet they don’t reward people for being risk-takers and innovators. Instead, the pervasive climate of efficiency and the bottom-line continue to dominate the workplace. In schools, we hear the same thing. We want students to be innovative and take-risks but instead of focusing on creating the optimal space for doing this and developing a story for students to be risk-takers and innovators, we continue to discuss the same bottom line — assessment. The thru-line of the story is not risk-taking or innovation — it’s assessment and reporting</p>\n<p>Changing the story to allow for teachers and students to be risk-takers and innovators requires a change in mindset. It also requires that the focus of schools be learning where risk-taking and innovation are the focus of the story not the assessment. Maybe throwing out grades eliminates the punitive assessment practices but it still focuses on assessment. To create a climate for risk-taking and innovation, a focus on learning as a whole is critical to helping to change the mindset of people — a new story where risk-taking and innovation are central to the learning needs to be told.</p>\n<p><strong>Talk About the Learning</strong></p>\n<p>Many people have a fixed mindset when it comes to grading and grades. In other words they have “a set of beliefs or way of thinking that determine’s one’s behaviour, outlook and mental attitude.” It’s part of their cultural worldview and, as Seth Godin points out, getting people to change their worldview is very difficult — it’s admitting they’re wrong.</p>\n<p>In my experience over the last 10 years with shifting mindsets and school cultures away from traditional practices, talking about grading and grades is the least effective way to create a shift. Instead, talk about learning.</p>\n<p>When you discuss learning, it’s leads to a discussion of including and using formative assessment, the effective use of digital portfolios, the focus on taking risks, making mistakes, creativity and development, the use of differentiation for all students and the use of maker space/genius hour/inquiry/problem based learning.</p>\n<p>It allows the conversation to examine the different skills that people will need in the future and how these skills are built into learning through the use of collaboration, peer-assessments, continuous formative feedback, differentiation and the opportunities for redo’s where learning isn’t finite but truly life-long. Talking about assessment and grades misses out on the important part of the story — the learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Change the Story of School</strong></p>\n<p>Many people have a very static picture of school. Too often I hear/read about students still in desks, where rote copying off the board is the norm and weeks of standardized testing take place every year. Honestly, I have no idea what that is like. My own transition began 15 years ago when I removed the desks from my grade 7 classroom and began to explore Inquiry Learning. I quit giving finals 10 years ago when I once again began teaching senior Social Studies and PAA classes. My own experiences reinforced that talking about grading and grades was beginning with the wrong end of the learning story.</p>\n<p>As an administrator, changing the story of what happens in school is important. Connecting parents with classes and the school via social media allows parents to see that the story of school and the story of learning are changing and changing for the better for their children. Helping parents and students who were use to the traditional forms of learning and assessment is essential in helping a school culture transition. Telling a different story allows people to see themselves in a new way within the storyline. Without telling a complete story, but starting with assessment and grading, people are disconnected from the changes taking place in classrooms and the school, imposing their own story of learning which is incompatible with the changing story of assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>I Wonder….</strong></p>\n<p>My work with teachers and their stories of connection and change through connecting online make me more appreciative of the need to listen to the stories that people are telling about school and learning. In a world that is hyper-focused on assessment and grading, the story of learning is a by-line when it should be the headline. For decades the focus has been on test results, so much so that the current educational environment seems to rarely focus on the learning — it’s all about assessment. Maybe it’s time to change the story…..</p>\n<p>…. what would happen if learning and development were the focus of discussion rather than assessment and changing grading?</p>\n<p>….. why people continue to only tell a small part of the learning story with a focus on the end instead of the journey?</p>\n<p>…. what would happen if teachers were asked to focus on learning and innovation as much as they are being told to focus on assessment and assessment practices?</p>\n<p>….. what if the assessment rhetoric shifted to focusing on learning, risk-taking and innovation?</p>	2015-07-20 03:01:02.188263	2015-07-29 17:01:35.199444	<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*BdkB_xgID4Zfrf1v.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Toss the grades.</p>\n<p>Get rid of grades.</p>\n<p>Learners don’t need grades.</p>
148	8	Pebble Is Trying to Run Circles Around Apple	It’s still an underdog. But with the smart-watch equivalent of the Swatch, Pebble is graduating from the nerd market.	2015-09-23 17:00:01	a87d96590d3	\n<h3>Pebble Is Trying to Run Circles Around Apple</h3>\n<p></p>\n<h4>It’s still an underdog. But with the smart-watch equivalent of the Swatch, Pebble is graduating from the nerd market.</h4>\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Fashion is a funny thing. A single distinctive garment or accessory commonly requires an outlay that surpasses the annual income of most of the world’s population. Watches are an extreme example. There are cults of Rolex, Omega, and Patek Philippe, much to the pleasure of Rolex, Omega, and Patek Philippe. The Apple Watch, despite what seems like an ineluctably brief useful life span, clearly aspires to this class. Significantly, the one new Apple Watch accessory announced at the company’s marathon event earlier this month was a Hermes leather band priced at one thousand five hundred dollars. No one blinked, because Apple had already beat it into our brains that its Bluetooth bauble is a luxury item. Its videos had spread the word with respectful whispers, the kind reserved for speaking in the presence of kings and golf tournaments.</p>\n<p>But fashion also embraces the funky and the fun. Avatars of style often blend their premium garb with a cool accessory from the flea market or the bargain bin. Especially when the statement is straightforward and functional. Design stripped down to necessity can also be sexy.</p>\n<p>That is why <a href='http://www.swatch.com/en/' title='' rel=''>Swatch</a> sells millions of watches. They are promoted not by whispers, but joyful pop music, the kind that you sing out loud to in the shower. Swatches may not be expensive but neither are they outré</p>\n<p>Which brings us <a href='https://pebble.com/' title='' rel=''>Pebble</a>, a 160-person company making watches known for value, an avid developer community, and a geeky look that’s only slightly abashed. When I met with its CEO Eric Migicovsky recently, the 29-year-old Canadian sandbagged me. He entered the room with a handful of stuff, including a jewel case the size of a cigar box. Then we talked about Pebble strategy, a conversation climaxing with the announcement of a cosmetically enhanced version of his watch, called the Pebble Time Gold. “Not real gold,” he quickly added, which expresses the difference between Pebble and Apple in a nutshell. The PTG cost $250, fifty more than the Pebble Time Steel, with a metal matching watchband for another fifty</p>\n<p>Only after this marketing foreplay did he open the box, which, I should have realized, had been sitting on the table like the proverbial gun introduced in the first act of a play.</p>\n<p>Five watches were inside, and they were unlike any previous Pebbles. These were versions of what he calls the Pebble Time Round and as the name implies, they are <em>round</em>, like the vast majority of watches have been since the beginning of timepieces. And they are thin. The Pebble Time Round is 7.5mm thick. In comparison, the new <a href='https://www.motorola.com/us/products/moto-360' title='' rel=''>Moto 360</a> — one the best looking round smart watchs— is 11.4mm thick. (The Apple Watch is 10.5mm.</p>\n\n<p>In one sense, this is not overwhelming. This Pebble is about the thickness of a stack of four quarters, whereas the Apple Watch is exactly six quarters. But forget the measurements. The Pebble Time Round, with a nice leather band crosses the threshold where it looks like you’re not wearing one of those gadgets, but just…a watch. A watch that happens gives you email, sports scores, weather, texts, calendar items, and advance notice when hurricanes are coming. But it’s also casual and kicky enough to slip it on just to know what time it is.</p>\n<p>Pebble has just made the Swatch of smart watches.</p>\n\n<p>The Pebble Time Round itself is kind of a huge sandbagging, because Pebble had already made what people assumed was its big move in 2015. This was the Pebble Time, rolled out on Kickstarter on February. When Migicovsky showed it to me, he seemed to exude with confidence that it would be a huge hit. He also professed not to be bothered with the Cupertino juggernaut that many pundits assumed would stop the clock on Pebble. Only now — after the Pebble Time launch set records on Kickstarters— will he admit that maybe he had a doubt or two. “I guess a good CEO has to always be a little bit worried,” he says. At the company headquarters in downtown Palo Alto — the company will move soon to Redwood City — employees held a betting pool on the money pledged by users. “People at the company had some guesses all across the board from a couple million bucks to a lot more,” he says. “But I refrained. I had bet the whole company.”</p>\n<p>Within a few minutes, Migicovsky knew that his bet had paid off. On that first day, over 40,000 people flooded the site to order $9 million worth of Pebble Time watches. (The current tally tops $20 million.)</p>\n\n<p>But in barely more time than the bubbles in the champagne he cracked open that day went flat, Pebble got a reminder of where it stood in the larger scheme of things. “We sold a hundred thousand Pebble Times on Kickstarter within thirty days,” says Migocovsky. “And then [two weeks later] Apple came through and sold anywhere between 1.5 and 3 million.” In its first <em>weekend</em></p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Apple Watch — as well as the Android wearables that compete with it — can do things that the Pebble can’t match. Unlike the Pebble, the Apple Watch (as well as a number of Android Wearable watches) instantly allows you to do almost all of the most sophisticated smart phone tasks. Its display is incandescent. And the Apple Watch has an array of versatile sensors that make it a virtual workout coach and even a cardiologist.</p>\n<p>But Pebble has a plan. Migicovsky goes to the whiteboard to draw two curves, on similar upward trajectory, one six or seven inches higher than the lower The upper curve represents Apple and its Android counterparts. These are watches with “cell-phone-class technology.” They can improve, but only as fast as new technology allows them. They are locked into their high costs and performance.</p>\n\n<p>“We, on the other hand, are following a curve that is much cheaper by default, but have different options,” says Migicovsky. “Those other guys can’t go down — they can’t fundamentally get down to our level without dramatically changing their course of curve [because they have set the feature baseline at a very high level]. Whereas we can easily jump up and say, okay well there’s actually a sensor that the other guys are using, we can incorporate that into our technology.” For an example he cites the the e-paper display on the Pebble Time watch, which brought color to the company’s products, but in a low-cost implementation.</p>\n<p>“So what our company is betting on,” he says, “is that in the future, as we wear more and more technology on our body, the curve that we are riding will be better suited for building that technology.”</p>\n<p>Right now, the Pebble’s populist approach also offers some other advantages. It is an open system that works with both Android and Apple phones. It encourages people to hack its innards, so Pebble has a fanatical developer community. And its not-so-secret weapon is a battery life that lasts about a week.</p>\n\n<p>What <em>was</em> a secret is that Pebble was working on a smaller version with a round watch face. “This is not a one-look world,” says Migicovsky. “We’re not one and done — it’s not going to be one Pebble that comes in a couple different colors and that’s it. People will be wearing computers on their body and it seems inappropriate to think that people don’t have individual styles and they aren’t interested in different things to wear and include on their body.” Specifically, Pebble believed that none of the current field of smart watches were really good fits for women, or men with small wrists. (Migicovsky himself, despite his six and a half foot height, claims to be one of these.) It was clear that a round form factor would represent a jump in stylishness — but the key would be slimming down the body</p>\n<p>“Your our only alternative up until this point, if you wanted something round, was a hockey puck,” he says.</p>\n\n\n<p>The result was something that, according to Pebble’s chief of staff Kristin Culp, weighs about half of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoirdupois' title='' rel=''>avoirdupois</a> of an Apple Watch. (Actually, even the lighter versions of Apple Watch, including band, are more than <a href='http://robservatory.com/the-all-in-one-apple-watch-spreadsheet/#prettyPhoto/0/' title='' rel=''>twice the weight</a> of the new 29 gram Pebble.) “It’s so light I forget I’m wearing it,” she says</p>\n<p>You would think that the challenge of making a smart watch that lightweight would require a bus full of geniuses smuggled out of the Apple design lab. And it is true that some hardware wizardry was required in engineering the case and overcoming some other challenges. But it was actually one single factor allowed Pebble to manufacture the Pebble Round. And it was less a feat of technology than it was a compromise.</p>\n<p>Mainly, they just made the battery smaller.</p>\n<p>It turns out that for smart watches most of what occupies the enclosure is devoted to energy storage. By shrinking the battery, you could move from hockey puck to poker chip. So instead of the Pebble Time’s week of battery life, the round version is good for only two days. This erodes one of Pebble’s key advantages. But to compensate, Pebble has devised a quick-charge capability that takes a drained watch up to 80 percent in fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p>Of course there were other issues. “When you start getting this small, things start hitting into each other,” says Migicovsky. “The other thing was whether could we re-imagine the Pebble experience in a circular form factor.”</p>\n<p>This has been a thorny issue, as information generally wants to be displayed in a rectangle or square, and circles — while superb for time-telling — aren’t really optimal for reading.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Pebble had planned for this in advance. When the company switched to a new operating system earlier this year — organizing information around a timeline — it forced developers to format information in a way that would be separated from the ultimate means of display. Thus when ESPN handles data about the score of a football game, for instance, the Pebble operating system can show it to the user in either a square or circular format — without cutting off any information. (Think how lame it would have been if your favorite team’s point total was lopped off by the curve of a circle.)</p>\n<p>The scheme isn’t perfect — “Watch faces, for example, don’t work magically,” admits Migicovsky. And it remains to be seen how much Pebble’s approach will really keep all the information inside the circle. But he believes the extra effort required of developers will be more than worth it. “The benefits of going to a circle will really spark people’s imaginations,” he says. “I mean, [round is] the classic watch, right?</p>\n<p>Another twist to the Pebble Time Round is that two of the five models accommodate a slimmer size leather band — 14mm wide, as opposed to 20mm on the other three. That’s the classic size of a “ladies” watch. “So on a woman’s wrist, for example, we think Pebble Time Round is the first smart watch that looks appropriate,”says Migicovsky.</p>\n<p>Since even the wider band on the other three models is a bit slimmer than that of previous Pebble watches (22mm), this means that Pebble now has three different widths for its bands. This is somewhat of a drawback for Pebble’s development community, which now must design for three sizes of watchbands, figuring out how many of each to manufacture. (Third-party watchband makers are important to Pebble since the company has opened the door for “smart bands” that introduce some of the sensor technology that the Pebble otherwise lacks.) “We’ve got them working double time,” says Migicovsky. But they will need to work triple time.</p>\n\n<p>The company plans to ship units on November 8, with preorders being taken at Best Buy, Target and Amazon as well as Pebble’s own site. It comes in silver, black and (hold on, Tim Cook)… rose gold. The price? $250. “I think this solidifies who Pebble is and what we’re building for,” says Migicovsky. “We are explicitly not trying to build the Rolex of the world.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, that’s exactly one-sixth what you would pay for an Apple Watch band from Hermes. In fact, the Pebble Time Round’s low price and lightweight, non-geeky look might well move some Apple Watch owners to add one of these for casual wear. After all, the word “Swatch” is a portmanteau of the words “second watch.”</p>\n<p>Co-existence with Cupertino would be just fine for Eric Migicovsky. “Pebble is not going to just run over Apple — I think it would be foolish to say otherwise,” he says. “But we are shooting some pretty good pebbles at the Goliath.”</p>\n<p><em>This is the second in the series “Adventures of Pebble.” I will drop in on Migicovsky and his team periodically for inside views of how the company is faring.</em></p>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>\n<><a href='https://medium.com/p/6e6f4cc6d372' title='https://medium.com/p/6e6f4cc6d372' rel=''><strong>Time Bandit: Pebble’s New Weapon in its Battle with Apple and Android Watches</strong>\n<em>The “indie” wearable company goes back to Kickstarter.

The sector has frequently operated under the assumption that improving one of the three objectives — access, quality or price — is necessarily at the expense of one or both of the others. Like health care, costs in higher education rise faster than in other industries where technology can be more easily deployed to increase productivity.</p>\n<p>Breaking the iron triangle has become more pressing issue for higher education’s stakeholders as student debt hits record highs, institutional costs rise faster than inflation, and access to higher education becomes a social and economic imperative for nations struggling with challenges of global competition.</p>\n<><em>“We can’t allow higher education to be a luxury in this country.

While much maligned, the “lecture” course is very economical;</li>\n<li>Greater reliance on adjunct/sessional instructors, which allows institutions to adjust supply quickly as demand rises and falls, at a far lower cost that full-time faculty;</li>\n<li>Mega-universities. While not common in Western nations (save for <a href='http://www.open.ac.uk/about/main/strategy/facts-and-figures' title='' rel=''>Open University UK</a>), these institutions, according to an analysis by <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Mega-universities-Knowledge-Media-John-Daniel/dp/0749426349' title='' rel=''>Sir John Daniel</a>, have a lower per-student cost</li>\n<li>By simply creating more universities: many Western nations funded a new crop of all-purpose universities in the mid-twentieth centuries to serve the first of the baby boomers and feed an increasingly post-industrial workforce.</li>\n<li>Participation in consortia with the hope that sharing resources, rather than going it alone, reduces costs. (My own analysis of online consortia found that this objective often remains elusive.)</li>\n<p>::</p>\n<p>The impact of technology-mediated learning in higher education on costs, quality and access has been, to date, moderate. While the online format has added significant value, particularly through convenience for adult and working learners, it has not led to downward pressure on tuition or significantly increased participation rates. And certainly online education’s scalability pales in comparison to the new breed of Internet-born companies we hear about so often these days. (Instagram was sold for 1 billion dollars when it had only 13 employees.) For our purposes here, let’s set aside the terrifying labour implications of this particular example.</p>\n<p>The challenge of scale in higher education is not merely technological — it’s organizational and social, as well. While achieving scale is fundamental to most enterprises, it can be deleterious in higher education. Increasing access and reducing price can actually hamper an institution’s value in the marketplace. Value is based, in part, on maximizing exclusivity: an institution’s reputation typically increases when it admits fewer applicants than competing institutions. When we tell friends that our daughter “got into a good school” we mean, in effect, a school that is relatively difficult to get in to. The recent statements by Peter Thiel about the unique economics of higher ed, who made his fortune through highly scalable Internet-based businesses, are amusing in this context:</p>\n<>“[Higher education admissions is] a crazy tournament. It’s a zero-sum tournament. If you were the president of Harvard or Stanford and you wanted to get a lynch mob of students, alumni, and faculty to come after you, what you should say is something like this: We live in this much larger, more global world. We offer this great education to everybody. So we’re going to double or triple our enrolment over the next 15 to 20 years. And people would all be furious, because the value of the degree comes from massive exclusion. And what you’re really running is something like a Studio 54 night club that’s got an incredibly long line outside and a very small number of people let inside. It’s branded as positive sum, everybody can learn, but the reality is that it is deeply zero sum.”</>\n<p>The same claim can be made about price: Increasing tuition levels can increase exclusivity, which in turn, increases perceptions of value. New York University and George Washington University have taken this tactic to heart according to Daniel Luzer (see <a href='http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/feature/the_prestige_racket.php?page=all' title='The prestige racket by Daniel Luzer' rel=''>The Prestige Racket</a>)</p>\n<p>The good news is that educational technology has matured to the extent that it can now have a major impact on costs, access, and quality. It scales. Some of the more promising applications of technology include:</p>\n<li>Software that generates automated, real-time feedback to students on their performance. This instructional technique frequently increases student retention of the curriculum and ensures that the student doesn’t proceed to the next unit of curriculum with misconceptions about the curriculum;</li>\n<li>Sharing common instructional content across as many courses and programs as is suitable in order to ensure (a) the lowest possible cost per student and (b) access to the highest possible quality (at a given price);</li>\n<li>Adaptive, personalized learning that identifies and responds to student differences — an instructional tactic that’s not feasible in most mid to large size courses due to the demands it places on instructional staff;</li>\n<li>Course authoring applications with instructional intelligence embedded within the software. LMS typically don’t seek to guide instructors/authors toward best (better practices). But new, more sophisticated applications have been developed that make it possible to generate learning activities that are beyond the capacity of what most instructors can achieve independently. (In this respect, educational technology will become more similar to other, time and labour saving technologies, such as desktop accounting software that, for example, directs the user toward adhering to accounting standards and rules, or blogging software like Wordpress that makes it possible for content creators with stunted design sensibilities to create beautiful, easy-to-navigate sites.)</li>\n<p>Most importantly, each of these applications of technology reflect what educators have told us is valuable to students. The technology isn’t dictating the instructional method; rather, it reflects our best thinking and practices while allowing us to scale education, one of our most important and precious resources.</p>\n<p>::</p>\n<p><em>Keith Hampson, PhD is part of the team at <a href='http://acrobatiq.com' title='' rel=''>Acrobatiq</a>, a Carnegie Mellon University venture.</em></p>	2015-07-20 03:01:03.869071	2015-07-27 23:01:14.102493	<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/600/0*ULGh9al_R09eHzwG.jpg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The “iron triangle” of cost, quality and access in higher education has seemed, at times, unbreakable.

Those kids are lazy. Those kids don’t care. Those kids aren’t motivated. Those kids are disrespectful. Those kids are ‘bad’.</p>\n<p>More than anything, I worry about the last one.

The ones with straight A’s. The ones that let us teach. The ones that are quiet.</p>\n<p>As an educator you will not like every single student. Every relationship will not be perfect. I have struggled with students before. I will struggle with students in the future. I am not perfect. I am not the world’s best teacher. No matter my relationship, I maintain that each student is a ‘good’ kid. Blaming the child for a inherent character defect is an excuse. It is a cop-out. It is not what we should do as educators. Students reflect the attitude we have toward them. Students live up to the labels we place on them.</p>\n<p>I challenge all educators, including myself, to fight the urge to call students ‘punks’. I challenge all educators, including myself, to fight the urge to name students at one school better than others. I challenge all educators, including myself, to honor the difference of all schools and communities. I challenge all educators, including myself, to start from a place of empowerment, not deficit.

Will…	2015-08-28 17:25:47	5c5cdb3d8797	<h2>The Phone Company and the Feds — a Buddy Movie from Hell</h2>\n<h4>For over 65 years, this private-public alliance has partnered in surveillance, changing the laws when they seemed to get in the way. Will this story ever change?</h4>\n\n<p>This month’s <a href='http://nyti.ms/1ITtAeq' title='' rel=''>news</a> that AT&T has evidenced “extreme willingness to help” the NSA collect, filter, analyze, and disseminate billions of communications by Americans wasn’t particularly surprising. After all, the giant phone company has been tightly involved with America’s national security operations for decades</p>\n<p>The obvious next question: Who will get to boss whom around? I offer three data points that may help us find an answer.</p>\n<p>The first involves antitrust, and the strange resolution of the executive branch’s balancing of two different government interests involving the phone company. Back in 1949, AT&T, then also known as the Bell System, had complete dominion over phone service in the U.S. So it was a big deal when AT&T insisted on buying all of its phones from a single supplier: Western Electric, which just happened to be one of its subsidiaries. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice was concerned that AT&T was inflating Western Electric’s phone prices in order to charge subscribers more, and sued to force the company to divest that manufacturing subsidiary.</p>\n<p>At about the same time that lawsuit was filed, however, the government came to AT&T to ask a favor. The Atomic Energy Commission needed an institution to manage the national atomic bomb stockpile in New Mexico, and asked AT&T. The company pointed out to the Chairman of the AEC that the DOJ’s antitrust lawsuit “seeks to terminate the very same Western Electric-Bell Laboratories-Bell System relationship which gives our organization the unique qualifications to which you refer” in asking that the Bell System manage the atomic material. AT&T then took over operation of the production of atomic weapons and continued to manage the stockpile for 25 years.</p>\n<p>The antitrust lawsuit dribbled on, the Cold War continued, and the Eisenhower administration came in — but now the phone company had much more leverage. By 1952, it seemed to the Eisenhower team that it would be a good idea to gracefully get rid of the antitrust suit. Attorney General Herbert Brownell met with the AT&T general counsel in July 1953 at the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; there, the general counsel reminded Brownell of AT&T’s “contribution to the national defense,” and Brownell said “a way ought to be found to get rid of the case” by agreeing to practices that could be enjoined with “no real injury” to the AT&T business. The Department of Defense strongly supported AT&T’s request to be free of the antitrust suit. And it was settled, without a divestiture remedy.</p>\n<p>The second data point occurred in the beginning of the 21st century. (By then, thanks to a series of mergers, the “AT&T” giant that had been broken apart in 1984 had essentially re-formed as a telecom giant.) At that time, AT&T employee Mark Klein was a Computer Network Associate working at a company facility in San Francisco. Klein noticed that a secure room, about 24 feet wide by 48 feet long, was being built next to the room housing the main switch — the physical set of computers transferring data from one network to another — and that access to that secure room was extremely limited. Only employees cleared by the NSA could enter the secure room.</p>\n<p>Klein also noticed that the signals from that switch’s optical circuits were being split, with a mirror image of the data they carried going into the secure room. Because he knew what was going on inside the switch, he could tell that copies of communications from and to many ISPs were being transferred to the secure room. He also learned that similar “splitter cabinets” were being installed in other cities, including Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Diego.</p>\n<p>In July 2008, after EFF sued AT&T on behalf of AT&T subscribers for what appeared to be — based on <a href='https://www.eff.org/node/55051' title='' rel=''>Klein’s report</a> — massive, illegal wiretapping of American communications, Congress promptly moved to award AT&T <a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr6304/text' title='' rel=''>retroactive immunity</a> from any liability in connection with the government’s warrantless wiretapping</p>\n<p>Here’s the last and most recent story. In 2010, the Inspector General for the Department of Justice — the watchdog inside the agency — issued two <a href='https://oig.justice.gov/special/s1001r.pdf' title='' rel=''>extraordinary</a> <a href='https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2014/s1408.pdf' title='' rel=''>reports</a> documenting the close relationship between communications service providers, primarily what it referred to as “Company A,” and the FBI in unlawfully obtaining non-content telephone records from 2003 to 2007. Together, the FBI and Company A had created an informal “exigent letter” process for getting this information to the FBI. The process violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, DOJ guidelines, and internal FBI policy; the letters themselves made factual misstatements and often couldn’t be matched to an investigation — a requirement under the law</p>\n<p>“Company A,” of course, <a href='https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/over-redaction-audit-fbi-s-use-illegal-exigent-let' title='' rel=''>was AT&T</a></p>\n<p>The OIG also reported that, often, Company A’s employees simply let FBI personnel look over their shoulders for “sneak peeks” — no letters used at all — at calling-activity information. Totally illegal. This wasn’t physically difficult: Company A employees, their computers hooked up to Company A’s databases, were co-located at FBI offices. Everyone was in the same space. The Company A personnel had FBI email accounts, called themselves “Team USA” members, and went to happy hours with their FBI colleagues.</p>\n<p>Company A wasn’t just sharing data with the FBI. It was also analyzing patterns and preparing visual presentations based on what it saw. Company A employees generated “exigent letters” for FBI employees to sign — letters asserting that an emergency mandated release of the data. It was sort of a three-ring circus of irregular practices: the FBI personnel weren’t getting any guidance about the lawfulness of these letters, didn’t keep copies of them, couldn’t track them, and didn’t understand what they meant. Meanwhile, Company A employees were speedy, constantly available, technically adept, and undeniably helpful.</p>\n<p>Ryan Singel, reporting for Wired, <a href='http://www.wired.com/2010/01/fbi-att-verizon-violated-wiretapping-laws/' title='' rel=''>revealed</a> that after the OIG reports came out the entire process was retroactively legalized</p>\n<p>Back to the present. Thanks to The <em>New York Times</em> and ProPublica, we’re looking at yet another instance of AT&T’s helpfulness: collecting, filtering, analyzing, and reporting data about American communications. The government may say that because it was AT&T doing the snooping, any Fourth Amendment strictures — applying to government actors, in general, and not to private parties — don’t matter. It also often takes the position that whatever AT&T does at its behest is a “state secret,” and thus the courts should simply not get involved. AT&T is already signaling that it will argue it hasn’t violated the law because voluntary disclosure of this information was necessary in order to protect American lives threatened by terrorism</p>\n<p>There will be bundles of legal arguments. EFF will point out that NSA can’t wash its Fourth Amendment obligations away by shifting its operations to a private company. And it seems dubious that a relationship on the front page of The New York Times can continue to be a “state secret.”</p>\n<p>But if history is our guide, AT&T will sternly declaim, as it always does, how central these invasions of privacy are to the country’s national defense. Someone will suggest that a settlement or some crazy form of retroactive, reverse-double-backflip immunity makes total sense in this context. And we’ll be back in our lawless, might-makes-right swamp all over again.</p>\n<p>We really haven’t moved much since 1949. Behind closed doors, AT&T treats government as, at best, a peer. The NYT/ProPublica-revealed documents make this clear: NSA employees are told not to think of this relationship as contractual. It’s a “partnership.” It’s a “<a href='https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/2274325-sso-news-fairview-tour-for-director-research.html' title='' rel=''>unique Government/Partner relationship</a>.</p>\n<p>AT&T and our government are not, and should not be, peers plotting how to avoid existing legal constraints by collaborating. But that seems to be what happens, over and over again.</p>\n<p>What’s the solution? The clear, accessible explanations of the independent <a href='https://www.pclob.gov/' title='' rel=''>Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board</a> have shone a bright light on the implementation of some of our national security surveillance programs. At least we’re now able to talk about (part of) what’s happening, and how legal it is. The only way we’ll get through this is to continue to support the PCLOB, continue the legal dialogue, and remember, always, that companies are subject to the rule of law</p>\n<p>And not the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>	2015-08-28 19:00:32.691537	2015-09-24 01:00:50.77844	<h2>The Phone Company and the Feds — a Buddy Movie from Hell</h2>\n<h4>For over 65 years, this private-public alliance has partnered in surveillance, changing the laws when they…</h4>

I’d like to start with a thought experiment.	2015-07-20 23:00:17	40e90b63f71f	<p></p>\n<p>I’d like to start with a thought experiment.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*dicQSJt7ijHRM7hWUfPzeA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>If we all know the environment and culture that is conducive to true learning, why do we choose to so often ignore these essentials and create stale and “do as I say, not as I do” learning opportunities? Why are words like “training”, “remembering”, and “review” consistently the frame we use to portray learning? As a father I’ve started to pay particular attention to how my own kids learn. I’ve noticed the ebb and flow of my own learning. The common element that connects all of these independent factors is curiosity. The ability to ask, ponder, contemplate, hypothesize, question, test, experiment, and then repeat the process, isn’t just confined to the world of science, but it’s also how my sons learn to play new games, how I develop better instructional approaches, and how infants figure out how to get attention when they are alone. Our strong sense of curiosity may be one of our most compelling human qualities.</p>\n<p>But, I think we’ve relegated curiosity to the sidelines in most formalized learning situations. Other “priorities” have seemed to take curiosity’s place. The didactic nature of learning, for individuals of all ages, has become by and far the most prevalent transmission of education in our country. Our systems of learning seem much more interested in compliance and standardization as opposed to nurturing curiosity. Our current system of one individual being the conduit of knowledge and skills to another group of individuals seems to reinforce the attributes that we least desire. Or maybe they don’t, but regardless, learning suffers when the “direction of learning” is hierarchical in its pattern of networking.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*w5bu_w3Cr76Jmcf_l0Tw3A.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I get why we think this pattern is best. It ensures a certain level of fidelity. It is a great example of “good enough”. What the evidence would show is that this “good enough” approach ensures standardization and uniformity, but has proven that it doesn’t work for everyone, in all situations, and to it’s fullest ability. The “good enough” approach creates those that “get it” and those that “never will”. The “good enough” approach creates individuals who are “bad at math” or hate to read or leave the “science” to someone else. The “good enough” approach perpetuates a world where someone else is responsible for asking the questions, discovering the solution, and solving our problems.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*DrIfnTtkExI-JfI_adnoPg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Is this truly the case? Shouldn’t we always be improving?</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Again, I don’t think that all of this started out to be malicious. Originally, standardization and uniformity were meant to be good things. But somehow along the way, we’ve lost our way. We’ve allowed this to supersede the pieces of our humanness that make each of us capable of being learners. Don’t mistake my intentions here. I’m not opposed to universal expectations and outcomes for all learners. In fact, I believe in them wholeheartedly, but universal expectations and outcomes are not the same as standardization and uniformity. Universality is the expectation that all learners will develop essential skills and knowledge that will empower them for a life-time.</p>\n<p>We as teachers should be focus all our efforts on “un-doing” <em>good enough. </em>We must treat our classrooms as laboratories of action research. We must not allow the cacophony to distract us from the outcomes that truly matter. We are the ones that must never settle for <em>good enough.</em></p>	2015-07-20 21:00:47.483649	2015-08-01 03:01:21.68667	<p></p>\n<p>I’d like to start with a thought experiment.</p>\n<p>If we all know the environment and culture that is conducive to true learning, why do we choose to so often ignore these essentials and create stale and “do as I say, not as I do” learning opportunities?

We need a third option. A third option requires a new paradigm for how to understand human behavior in relationship to human cognition.</p>\n<p>A third option focuses intently and intentionally on maintaining the mental health and overall integrity of a child’s brain and personality. The current vague and non-specific psychological theories of personality teachers are taught to apply in the classroom do not allow children to preserve the coordination and cohesiveness of their own unique sensory, motor, and nervous system capacities.</p>\n<p>Micromanaging the behaviors of a human being via drugs and/or therapy will have grave negative consequences for that person’s capacities to understand and organize information and orient himself in space and time in the ways that make the most sense to him sensorially, motorically, and cognitively.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*EMxgfek_m-IoirrHIOBYTw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Human behaviors allow and support the brain in its task of sensing internal and external information, assessing that information, and then forming conclusions about that information in order to make decisions for what to do next. Behaviors do not occur independently of the brain’s directives, but the brain is constantly cueing for behaviors to help it assess future information it predicts it will need. For example, a child about to cross a street anticipates a car might be coming so his brain directs him to engage in the behavior of rotating his neck left and right to position his eyes so they can take in the view of the road in case a car is approaching.</p>\n<p>All human behaviors serve a purpose and reflect how a human is CAPABLE of and is in fact understanding and managing the information present in any given moment. When adult authorities arbitrarily decide which behaviors are acceptable and which are not, it is the same as taking the pain sensors out of his skin. A child uses his pain sensors to orient safely in space. Individuals born without pain sensors suffer gruesome injuries their whole lives because they have no cues for how to safely orient their bodies in space.</p>\n<p>An individual’s array of behaviors serve many purposes, one of which is to allow him to safely orient in space. We cannot pick and choose for a child the behaviors he can or cannot rely upon in any given situation. We must help children orient their brains and bodies in our classrooms and other group situations using methods that do not require us to constantly modify and comment on their behaviors.</p>\n<p>All we have to do to successfully teach children is present information in ways they are CAPABLE of understanding it. We have thousands of ways of presenting information we can try before defaulting into behavior modification, or shipping the child off to therapy, or drugging him.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*1TaRmIZN-F2ErXa88Rw9xA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Gently helping children understand what to do next at all times instead of identifying them as disordered based upon their behaviors and putting them on behavior plans will eventually change the field of psychology from top to bottom someday and will dramatically decrease mental illness.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the emergence of artificially intelligent machines might help us treat the developing brains of our children with more accurate and humane methodologies.</p>\n<p>For example, if an instrument of AI was programmed to scan and interpret genetic information and was intermittently inaccurate, nobody would modify the machine’s output, it’s ‘final behaviors,’ they would modify the machine’s processing capacities to make sure the machine understood how to move from one piece of information to the next accurately.</p>\n<p>Conversely, I am a teacher and we teachers are taught how to modify the output of our children, their final behaviors after they have already sensed, assessed, organized, and decided upon a whole string of information that resulted in their final behaviors. We teachers are taught precisely how to modify our students’ behaviors when they exhibit inaccurate output of any kind. We are taught much more explicitly how to modify their final behaviors than we are to consider how they arrived at those behaviors in the first place. Every child behaves for reasons that make sense to him and that are important to him. When we modify their output to suit our own goals for them, we disorient them, confuse them, anger them, and I believe lead many of them towards mental illnesses.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*M1Tu-XqxwGcIYSeByRVjrg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>In the classroom setting, whenever a child goes off task, I have observed about half the teachers and teaching assistants will interpret the off-task behaviors as resulting from deliberate student defiance and stubbornness. These educators will then attempt to change the behavior of the child by giving the student a negative consequence or denying him a reward.</p>\n<p>Modifying behaviors through drugs OR therapy are not evidenced based options with conclusive evidence for how they work, they are simply our only options thus far. Just because they are our only options does not make them our best options. Similarly, a large majority of children will learn regardless of how we teach them or whether or not we modify their behaviors, subject them to therapy, or give them drugs. Because some children will always learn despite what we do or don’t do to them does not mean existing options are optimal. If any of our existing methods of teaching and raising children were optimal, 1 in 4 of them would not end up mentally ill at some point in their lives or for their whole lives.</p>\n<p>We teachers use a whole variety of behavior modification methods mostly by default. There are no theories of the human personality we can apply practically in the classroom that don’t involve behaviorism of some sort. We need a new biologically accurate theory of personality we can easily apply in our classrooms.</p>\n<p>What if we focus on the unique manner in which each child senses information, organizes and orients to it, and then forms predictive decisions for what to do next with that information. Helping a child expand his ability to understand the information in his environment according to how we want him to can be a routine and easy task if we focus on the child’s understanding rather than his behavior.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*qw3W_iDo-E6pJyQGdYluNA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Getting a child to have a specific relationship to any piece of information does not happen due to magic pills or magic behavior management plans. For a child to orient to information in specific ways he needs specific instructions for how to do so that MAKE SENSE TO HIM. Magic pills do not change how a child fundamentally senses, organizes, or orients to information. Just because a child is paying attention to information for longer amounts of time due to pills does not mean he is making sense of the information any better than he was before the pills. Forced behavioral changes do not equal better understanding of information. Forced behavioral changes lead to anger, rage, withdrawal, depression, anxiety, and/or mental illness.</p>\n<p>Modifying a child’s ability to UNDERSTAND information in a specific way might require many attempts and many environmental adaptations but can be done. Modifying the child’s behaviors destroys the integrity of his sensory, motor, and nervous systems as they do their jobs of taking in, assessing, concluding, and deciding what to do next. Modifying and inhibiting BEHAVIORS damages the developing brain and I believe it to be the leading contributor to mental illness.</p>\n<p>When a child does not behave according to how an adult wants him to, it doesn’t mean he has psychological problems or disorders. It means he senses, thinks, concludes, and decides differently than the adult does. It means the child has a different orientation to and relationship with the information in the classroom environment.</p>\n<p>Certainly there are instances when psychological therapy and drug therapies are warranted. However, we can easily help Andrew manage his relationship to the information we present him at school without first declaring him disordered. If Andrew is bouncing off the walls in school, drugging him will likely calm him down so he will behave more like his peers. What if we can simply create developmentally appropriate lessons for Andrew and consider the developmental level he is at instead of the developmental level we want him to be at? If Andrew does not receive constant negative consequences for how he behaves, this will calm him down more than anything. If he is set up to engage in learning experiences where he is successful, he will learn and thrive. He might need stations that captivate his interests in the classroom where he can move around and spend just a moment or two at each one due to a short attention span and the need to move. He might need more direct assistance. But we can surely come up with hundreds of ways to channel his exuberance, energy, and constantly shifting attention without declaring him disordered and drugging him or subjecting him to psychological therapy. (Occupational and physical therapy rock. They offer real strategies to help kids accomplish real life tasks.)</p>\n<p>We need a biologically accurate theory of personality that flows from observations for how behaviors reflect the unique manner in which each human being continuously understands and organizes the interplay of internal and external information in order to continuously orient him or herself in space and time to make predictive decisions for what to do next. When we artificially attempt to change this dynamic in a child by modifying his behaviors so the child can achieve an ideal adults have created for how his or behaviors should or should not be, he is forced to adapt in often extreme ways in order to maintain any sort of equilibrium. Cognitive and behavioral adaptations implemented to maintain one’s equilibrium when one is expected to constantly sense, think, and behave in ways that are dictated by other people are mental illnesses.</p>\n<p>If we artificially and forcefully change how a child orients himself in space and time by targeting his behaviors for modification according to the latest acceptable behaviors in vogue, we disorient, confuse and damage the child.</p>\n<p>We need to discard current theories of personality that create an ideal for how people should behave and then declare them disordered when they do not measure up properly to that ideal. We need to discard psychological theories that identify specific behaviors as disordered and then take medical or therapeutic steps to change those behaviors.</p>\n<p>A new biological personality theory would consider the fact that a human being’s relationship to information is really his primary and most crucial relationship. All mammals will form relationships with other mammals. We do not have to do anything special to ensure our children form relationships with us or others. If we harm how our children’s nervous systems are set up to take in, organize, and manage information, however, we damage every aspect of their existence because every aspect of their existence requires them to take in, organize, and manage information.</p>\n<p>Survival of the fittest is really survival of the individual who can organize, understand, and respond to information in the most optimal ways in relationship to the interaction between his own sensory, motor, and nervous systems and his ever changing environments. Behavior management destabilizes the integrity and coherence of a child’s unique sensory, motor and nervous systems and sets him up for unmanageable anxiety which leads to mental instability and then potentially mental illness.</p>\n<p>The psychological theories we teachers apply in the schools set our children up to have mental health problems that then must be treated by psychologists or psychiatrists. This is a vicious cycle we can easily alter by gently helping children figure out what to do next cognitively throughout the school day instead of micromanaging their behaviors.</p>\n<p>It is destabilizing to not know when or how your thoughts and behaviors will be commented upon, drawn attention to, or forcibly altered. Whether this process is done gently or roughly by an adult authority, the process is totally destabilizing and anxiety provoking to a child. Anticipating destabilization causes children to withdraw or become hyper active due to the anxiety. Children often behave erratically and wildly when destabilized or anticipating destabilization, ensuring they will receive ever more behavior modification. The integrity of the child’s relationship to information, how he senses, assesses, and makes predictive decisions for what to do next becomes ever more confused. And that child becomes ever more passive and/or aggressive.</p>\n<p>Children deal with mountains of old and new information every single day of their lives. They do not have the stored memories or the experience base of the adult authorities. Adults often assume children should know how to behave appropriately at all times when the children are clueless about the information they must know in order to call up the expected behaviors from their stored memories. Even when a child has seemingly mastered material, he can still become confused by it because he is an inexperienced child.</p>\n<p>There are a million ways to become cognitively confused and disoriented by each child in each classroom each day of the year. When we fixate on behaviors during moments of confusion or perceived wrong doing, we miss hundreds of teaching moments and we destabilize and damage our children in the process.</p>\n<p>Instead of drugging or requiring psychological therapy, we need to help children preserve the integrity of the totally unique relationship they each have with the information in their environments that they must continuously sense, assess, conclude, and form predictive decisions about in the ways that make the most sense to each of them.</p>	2015-07-21 01:00:55.474056	2015-08-01 05:01:18.140286	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*wSYgZlL3NF5nu7pvN5ALTg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>As long as behaviors are the attributes we rely upon to diagnose and…</p>
85	6	How Do You Connect With the World?	Current World Events	2015-07-20 23:02:52	bf502a11bd50	<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*WmmLfoFFBya-wVor.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p><strong>Current World Events</strong></p>\n<p>That was a title on a board that has been in a few rooms when I’ve taught Social Studies. The idea is that students need to connect with what is happening in the world.</p>\n<p>Sounds simple.</p>\n<p>Not really.</p>\n<p>With the different worldviews students bring to the classroom, world events can be a somewhat hotspot for discussions. Events around the world aren’t simple, not that they ever were. But we are now beginning to discuss what previously was non-discussable and that can be difficult in a classroom.</p>\n<p>What are some of the different options that teachers have when trying to use current world events as points of discussion in the classroom? How can they address some of these issues? What if they have no idea where to start?</p>\n<p><strong>Avoidance</strong></p>\n<p>One option is not to. It’s sounds rather odd that the events happening in the world would be ignored but, for some teachers, this is the simplest way to avoid any type of controversy. Surface treatment of issues that mentions or references events can pass as “covering” if techniques of “read the article, answer the questions” is used. Short discussions that name people and places pass as covering the issue as teachers, worried about what might be said, avoid discussions or debates that might come up and certainly avoid any discussion of privilege, discrimination, oppression, persecution and other discussions that may make people, including the teacher, uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>It’s important to reflect upon how our actions and words impact and influence students. When I began teaching, I wasn’t aware of my own privilege or how it provided a very narrow worldview of events that took place in the world. As I have been made aware of my privilege and come to understand that this privilege taints my own view of events, using world events in my own teaching has changed.</p>\n<p>As a young teacher, I use to think that I had a pretty good idea of the different points of view of various events. Naive as I was, it did not stop me from using various sources to examine and open discussions about events as they took place. As the opportunity to connect with others became easier, the opportunity to see different views of events also became easier. Just as the images in a kaleidoscope change as you turn it, so to do views of any event change depending on the point of view. For a teacher, it can be somewhat difficult to know what to do or how to approach any topic in the classroom.</p>\n<p>It can be a challenge. Most definitely.</p>\n<p>But the great thing is that students can often lead us if given the opportunity.</p>\n<p>But we have to be willing to speak up.</p>\n<p><strong>Being Quiet Isn’t An Option</strong></p>\n<p>Early this year, <a href='http://thereadinessisall.com/about/' title='' rel=''>David Theriault</a> wrote a post <a href='http://thereadinessisall.com/2015/06/19/the-injustice-of-staying-quiet/' title='' rel=''>The Injustice of Staying Quiet.</a> Like all great posts, this one has had me thinking since I first read it. David makes some great points as he describes his own journey, one where I glimpse myself a few times but, truthfully, is much different from my own childhood growing up in a small town in Saskatchewan with little exposure to other cultures. I was unaware of the various privileges that I had as I grew up and it wasn’t until much later in life I began to realize how this influenced my worldview and the impact it had on my teaching. My mother, who has had a great influence on me, was a leader, one of the first females to serve as a union representative, working at many projects as she raised three children and took care of my father who was hurt in an accident. I was aware of being different, not having the same “normal” family made one an outsider but I didn’t realize until much later the great sacrifice she made or the abuse she suffered because of her work. To this day I am forever grateful for all that she taught me, and still teaches me, about helping others</p>\n<p>When David says</p>\n<><em>And that’s one of the points I would like to make. If you are not listening to other voices, it’s hard to move beyond your fixed notion of what is right and wrong. What we call, in my family, social justice.</em></>\n<p>I still struggle with uneasiness, unsure of what to do or what to say, fearful that I will offend someone because of my lack of understanding or my ignorance of what is happening or simply because I do not understand at all.</p>\n<p>So I remain quiet.</p>\n<p>That is a mistake.</p>\n<p><a href='http://kellychristopherson.ca/wp/archives/2401' title='' rel=''><strong>Connecting Students with the World</a></strong></p>\n<p>This past Thursday during #saskedchat, our topic for the chat was Connecting our students with the World. It was focused on different ways that teachers can use current events in their classroom. During the chat, I kept wondering how teachers approach social justice issues with students. Teachers offered ideas for discussing issues with students such as using different sources to examine how different points of view reporting the same issue and how social media sources such as twitter can be used for social justice issues. Whatever we do, I agree with David:</p>\n<><em>So what can we DO?</em></>\n<><em>Well I’ll tell you what we can’t do. We can’t make excuses and we can’t just ignore things and hope they will go away.</em></>\n<p>I highly recommend you take a moment to <a href='http://thereadinessisall.com/2015/06/19/the-injustice-of-staying-quiet/' title='' rel=''>read through David’s whole post</a> as it is extremely thoughtful and thought provoking plus David has taken the time and effort to add some great resources. One great resource that David shares is a <a href='https://twitter.com/davidtedu/lists/social-justice-fighters/members' title='' rel=''>social justice twitter list</a> with different people on twitter that I recommend following. However, for me, one of the greatest resources that David provides is his honesty and straightforward approach to the subject and his challenge for educators to address social justice issues</p>\n<p><strong>How Do I Connect?</strong></p>\n<p>Just this weekend, <a href='https://twitter.com/vhill01' title='' rel=''>Vincent Hill</a>, someone who I know via twitter, shared the resource <a href='http://sttpcanada.ctf-fce.ca/en/' title='' rel=''>Speaking Truth To Power</a> with me that I then shared with others.

To start bringing these issues into the classroom? To open up the dialogue with students?</p>\n<p>I don’t have answers. In fact, I have many questions and am still uncertain about so many things. One thing I am certain about though is that, as teachers, we cannot avoid talking about these issues. With so many resources available and, more importantly, access to people who can help us and speak to students about these issues, there is someone who is wiling help us if we just reach out and ask for their help and guidance. We live during one of the greatest periods of change in history and it’s important that we involve students in discussions about what is happening.</p>\n<p><strong>I Wonder….</strong></p>\n<p>So often our focus is planning and assessment, an almost obsession with assessment in its various forms, that relationships and the changes society and the world are experiencing seem mere data points on someone’s data chart.</p>\n<p>…. what might change if we began with the conditions and stories of students lives before we worried about which assessment tool/format teachers were using?</p>\n<p>…. if learning is truly the goal, why we are fixated with assessment instead of all the wonders of learning and possibilities that are available for children to explore what is happening in the world?</p>\n<p>…. if helping students develop skills for the future, why so much emphasis is placed on knowledge of the past?</p>\n<p>…. how teachers might change their practices to allow for more opportunities to explore various societal issues in meaningful ways?</p>	2015-07-21 01:00:54.73344	2015-08-02 21:01:27.296425	<p></p>\n<p><strong>Current World Events</strong></p>\n<p>That was a title on a board that has been in a few rooms when I’ve taught Social Studies.

21	3	The Productive Struggle	Aha! Moment	2015-06-04 20:31:01	1266c1a10ad4	<h4>Aha! Moment</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>The CCSS have been in existence for nearly 5 years. This time of transition has not been easy and it has challenged our way of thinking about education. Expectations for our students have changed, our way of teaching has changed, and our curricula has changed.</p>\n<p>Teachers are pressured to ensure their students successfully meet these standards, with minimal time and resources for preparation. They often don’t have a choice in the curriculum that is implemented or the structures put into place to execute it. The reality of student learning gaps and limited instructional time results in huge pacing challenges. These challenges are also often augmented by lack of support resources for teachers and parents.</p>\n<p>Although these challenges can make success seem next to impossible, districts that are sticking with it are seeing results. When there is a collective and sustained effort from superintendents, instructional leaders, teachers, and parents, the struggle pays off. Curriculum and instructional tools play an integral part in supporting educators to face these challenges.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*RRhoWu23SFk4nGdahYybuA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Students are beginning to exhibit a deeper understanding of math concepts so they are better able to articulate their thinking and solve problems. A conceptual foundation is being built from a very early age, which deepens students’ understanding of math. This understanding is carried over from year to year and as a result learning gaps are beginning to shrink. Parents are also expressing fewer concerns as more support and resources become available.</p>\n<p>Children are rising to the challenge of understanding math conceptually instead of procedurally or by rote.

84	6	Burn Your Resume. Burn Your Indefinite Mindset	Don’t let padding your resume determine the course of your life. Discover what you could make great instead.	2015-07-20 23:03:26	5d61ae75f52d	<>Photo Credit: <a href='https://unsplash.com/thomaslefebvre' title='' rel=''>Thomas Lefebvre</a></>\n<p>I was recently speaking to a young person (~Age 20 or 21) who was telling me about his aspirations. He wanted to go work at a startup, see what it is like to found a company, and eventually go launch his own firm. He wanted to go and create value in the world — to be his own boss, to satisfy customers, and to leave an impact on the world around him.</p>\n<p>Even more, he hated school (but loved learning). He knew he didn’t have to be there to do what he wanted to do. He knew he could learn the things he wanted better and in less time at a lower cost outside the classroom.</p>\n<p>So, of course, I asked him, “what’s keeping you from doing that right now?”</p>\n<p>“Well, you see, I want to be an officer in this club on campus.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you be involved in the things the club does without being an officer on campus?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, but then I couldn’t add it to my resume. I feel like that would be a good thing to have on there, just in case.”</p>\n<h3><strong>Two Futures: Indefinite and Definite</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>He was letting his resume (or, more specifically, the idea of “falling back on your resume”) hold him back. He was in an <strong>indefinite mindset </strong>— working to indefinitely increase his chances so that indefinite people might give him indefinite opportunities in an indefinite future. Despite having a decent idea of where he wanted to be in the future, he had no definite plan for getting there. His resume was the tool for navigating that indefinite future</p>\n<p>The resume is the embodiment of this indefinite mindset.</p>\n<p>It’s a generic list of things to pad our chances of landing a job in the future. In order to maximize the number of impressive things on this list, we may pass up great opportunities to get us where we want to go sooner. We choose the “okay” over the “great.” We choose the “not-quite” over the “there.” We fall into a mindset where we work towards things getting better, but we have no idea how or where they will get better.</p>\n<p>Burn your resume. <a href='http://blog.discoverpraxis.com/want-to-accelerate-your-career-burn-your-backup-plan/' title='' rel=''>Stop hedging your bets</a>. Get out of the mindset that keeps you from taking the big risks to get where you want to go</p>\n<p>Burn that indefinite mindset.</p>\n<p>Instead, cultivate a <strong>definite mindset</strong></p>\n<p>Figure out what you want from yourself, your career, and your life. Build a series of plans to get there.</p>\n<p>This takes time. You may have no idea where you want to be in 5 years right now. You may have no idea where you want to be in 1 year right now. But you can start figuring that out.</p>\n<h3><strong>A Challenge: Cultivate a Definite Mindset</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are two ways we can figure out what we want from our futures.</p>\n<p>The first is to figure out what we are good at and enjoy and to whittle down the combinations from there. This is very hard. There are lots of things that can be done with any one skill set, and there are new things popping up all the time. You may not know what you are good at yet, too. You may not know what you really enjoy. To figure out what you are good at, what you enjoy, and what option(s) you have to make a future out of the first two variables takes an immense amount of work.</p>\n<p>The second way is to <a href='http://zakslayback.com/2014/09/15/dont-do-things-you-dont-like-doing/' title='' rel=''>figure out what you <em>don’t</em> enjoy</a> and what you <em>are not </em>good at and removing these things from your life. As you do this, you begin to notice your quality of life increasing. For example, I hate paperwork. I hate filing it, I hate organizing it, I hate the minutiae that has to go into properly dealing with it. I remove as much paperwork from my life as possible. This means I could never be a bureaucrat, a social worker, an accountant, or any number of careers that rely heavily on paperwork. By removing doing paperwork from my life as much as possible, I have more time to focus on the things I enjoy and more mental energy to focus on figuring out what other activities I do not enjoy</p>\n<p>Once you figure out what you are not good at and you do not enjoy, begin to devote yourself to the first way. You’ll remove a lot of the white noise that will make figuring what you enjoy and what you are good at possible.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve figured out what you are good at, focus on that relentlessly. Become an expert at that. Be around people who challenge you. Take risks that have a high payoff of helping you better yourself at what you enjoy and are good at. By focusing on these areas, you’ll be forced to develop a definite mindset. You cannot become better at a given skill or engage more deeply with a given interest without devoting yourself to a plan of action.</p>\n<p>Extrapolate this out onto your life. Be active. Be definite. Be better.</p>\n<p><em>Zachary Slayback is the Business Development Director for <a href='http://discoverpraxis.com/' title='' rel='nofollow'>Praxis</a>, a ten-month program for entrepreneurial learners.

140	8	Can You Rape a Robot?	Jerry Kaplan, author of “Humans Need Not Apply,” thinks that AI systems will have rights and responsibilities	2015-08-31 18:37:08	c5ea9d47aef8	<h2>Jerry Kaplan Has Written The Scariest AI Book Yet</h2>\n<h4>Will a robot marry your daughter? Should you tip a robot? Can you rape a robot? Just ask the author of “Humans Need Not Apply.”</h4>\n\n<p>Jerry Kaplan, a long-time entrepreneur and Fellow at the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics, has weighed in on the Great Robot Controversy with a book called <em>Humans Need Not Apply</em>. Kaplan doesn’t believe that robots will be conscious anytime soon, or maybe ever. But he thinks it doesn’t matter. Even though robots and artificial intelligence systems may not become conscious, he argues we will wind up treating them as if they are</p>\n<>As they become more cognitively dexterous, and assume more and more tasks once reserved for humans, he contends, robots will have legal rights and responsibilities: they will be able to own property, and may be punished for malfeasance. We will give them agency.</>\n<p>According to Kaplan, we really don’t have a choice in the matter. Robots (and the definition is broad enough to include AI-based distributed software systems) will increasingly be granted autonomy to conduct more and more actions without supervision. But robots don’t respect the social and moral niceties that humans are socialized to observe — unless humans design systems with those values built in. Since there’s no way to police how people design robots, we need to be able to control robot misbehavior in the wild.</p>\n<p>In Humans Need Not Apply, Kaplan envisions a happy future for humans, with robots doing both the literal and figurative heavy lifting. But if we don’t get that design-in-morality part right, things aren’t so sunny. In his words:</p>\n<>These machines may offer us unprecedented leisure and freedom as they take over our hard and unpleasant work. But they are also likely to be our stewards. . . The problem is that we may get only one shot at designing those systems to serve our interests — there may not be an opportunity for do-overs.</>\n<p>Over breakfast one recent morning, Kaplan and I discussed the progress of AI, the insinuation of robots in the workplace, and whether raping a robot might ever become a crime. He was wearing a suit, ready for a full day of television book promotion. As he became animated on various topics, his eyes bulged under his neatly coiffed grey mane, evocative of an aging rockabilly singer. We also laughed a lot, despite the seriousness of our topic. (Or maybe because the robot future he outlines, while plausible, has an element of the absurd to it, which he openly acknowledges.) Early in our conversation, he threw down a cudgel: “I think we’re headed for increasing trouble,” he said. “If we don’t take some kind of policy actions, things that pretty bad right now are going to potentially get a lot worse.”</p>\n<p>The interview is edited for clarity and length.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In your book you say we will grant robots moral authority — they will be held responsible for their actions. You also say that they will be able to own property and even inherit property and eventually operate in a way where they are out of our control. How do you make that leap?</strong></p>\n<p>You have a kid, right? When you have a kid, you think, obviously, you’re in charge. You’re <em>not</em> in charge. You sleep when your kid sleeps, you feed the kid when the kid is hungry. You’re a slave to your kid. The perception of who is in charge is in your head. [The same goes with robots.] So there are two ways to frame this. One of them is that robots are independent and you have to watch out for them. The more valuable point of view is that we’re just designing them wrong because we can’t control them. It’s an engineering problem</p>\n<p>I’m actually working on a project on this at Stanford. I don’t want robots pushing ladies off the sidewalk as they’re moving, that’s bad. And so that’s a design problem. The sidewalk isn’t designed for robots. We need to program the robot so that it would obey social conventions and give priority to people, and are able to deal with moral challenges. Not too many people in the field of robot building are thinking about or worrying about this issue.</p>\n<p>Think of it in terms of people and animals. Animals will take actions independent of their owners and you have a certain level of responsibility to control that animal but it is not as absolute as you might think. Your dog can go bite somebody and your liability is limited to certain kinds of things. They actually have a legal term for this now, it’s called the first bite theory. Once it has bitten somebody, now you are liable if it takes a second bite.</p>\n<p><strong>Still I’m trying to picture the legal change that would allow something else you predict, a robot to own property.</strong></p>\n<p>Well now I’m off into the stratosphere but it’s fun to think about.</p>\n<p><strong>A couple of times in this book, in discussing how we might grant robots some agency, you cite a precedent I’m not comfortable with — slave owning.</strong></p>\n<p>Oh you don’t like that?</p>\n<p><strong>Well, you are citing slave law not as something to be avoided at all cost, but a system that we might learn from in dealing with robots.</strong></p>\n<p>I respectfully disagree. Obviously we are not bringing back slavery.</p>\n<p><strong>Maybe you’re saying <em>we’re</em> going to be the slaves?</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s go through this. Slaves were not considered full human beings or people and there was a way that was dealt with in the law. The same thing can happen with robots, that’s all I’m saying. So that’s a model for what we can talk about with robots. It’s not unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Now in the book, when I go off the deep end at the end, which I was advised to do, saying that 50 to 100 years —</p>\n<p><strong>You’re saying you were <em>advised</em> to go wild? You believe this stuff, right?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m projecting things that are 50 or 100 years in the future. I have enough intellectual integrity that I would defend most of the things in the book… a few of them I have changed my views on, as I’ve learned more.</p>\n<p><strong>Well by the end of your book, you’re pretty much saying we will have robot overlords — call them “mechanical minders.”</strong></p>\n<p>It is plausible that certain things can [happen]… the consequences are very real. Allowing robots to own assets has severe consequences and I stand by that and I will back it up. Do I have the thing about your daughter marrying a robot in there?</p>\n<p><strong>No</strong></p>\n<p>That’s a different book. [Kaplan has a sequel ready.] I’m out in the far future here, but it’s plausible that people will have a different attitude about these things because it’s very difficult to not have an emotional reaction to these things. As they become more a part of our lives people may very well start to inappropriately imbue them with certain points of view.</p>\n<p><strong>You don’t have robots marrying your daughter in this book, but you do write about robot sex.</strong></p>\n<p>The question is, is that a sex toy or is there somebody there?</p>\n<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Alone-Together-Expect-Technology-Other/dp/0465031463' title='' rel=''><strong>Sherry Turkle believes </a>that in our interactions with robots there’s something immoral about tricking people into thinking that there’s someone there, even in something less creepy than sex, like elder care robots.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have read her books, so I get where she’s coming from. She is saying that it’s wrong to fool people. To me, if you’re not fooling people, it’s okay. Here’s a machine that’s going to pretend to love you? Go for it, have fun. You want to love it back? That’s your business. You understand what it is. But if you think this robot really loves you, that’s bad because someone must have designed it to highjack your emotional life, so that you behave in a way which is not in your right interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Maybe your thought process would be, “Yeah I know it’s a robot but I love her anyway.”</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t mind that. Like, what does it matter whether they are made out of meat or whether they are made out of [machined parts]? That’s a meaningless distinction.</p>\n<p><strong>You predict that in 50 years people won’t even talk about whether robots think or have consciousness. It won’t matter because for all practical purposes we’ll treat them as if that’s the case.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s like the way we think of horses or something. If you want to treat it with respect, that’s your business. But we’re not evolutionarily programmed to necessarily deal with this in the right way.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think people could be prosecuted for more than destroying property if they hurt a robot?</strong></p>\n<p>You’ve got an interesting point. Can you rape a robot? That’s a great title for a piece in the <em>Atlantic</em></p>\n<p><strong>I’m definitely going to use it.</strong></p>\n<p>You can get it to print faster than I can. …</p>\n<p><strong>So answer the question: Can you rape a robot? We outlaw sex with animals.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m coming down on the no side. You can rape somebody else’s robot — but you can’t rape your own robot. The point is I’m damaging your property.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re saying robots can have property, they can have a will —</strong></p>\n<p>You’re pushing me in a direction I’m not comfortable with.</p>\n<p><strong>You wrote it!</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s be careful. If a robot can own property, that has certain consequences which are very significant. We should be aware of that, that’s important. That’s my point.</p>\n<p><strong>But it’s a concept you introduce. Before I read your book, I hadn’t thought about the concept of robots owning property.</strong></p>\n<p>But it’s important.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you saying it’s a good idea?</strong></p>\n<p>No I’m saying we will need to restrict this. In some way.</p>\n<p><strong>Who <em>is</em> saying robots should own property?</strong></p>\n<p>There will be pressure to do so in the same way that corporations [own property].</p>\n<p><strong>Pressure from whom, the robots?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the people who <em>own</em> the robots. One way to limit your liability is to push it down to a corporate entity or a robot. And that’s what we do today. You can’t have a robot that has no responsibility for its actions. Somebody has to be responsible. People will say a robot needs to be able to own assets because I gotta have something to go after. Society is not going to agree that anything a robot does is perfectly fine. So he’s got to have assets. But there is a difference between having a corporation own assets and having a robot own assets. A robot can do things with those assets that we may not be happy with. We’re okay with a corporation doing things, because people are benefitting from the actions. But a robot can get loose and disconnected from its economic owners, and run roughshod</p>\n<p>[At this point Kaplan wants a refill of his tea and is trying to get the attention of the restaurant staff.]</p>\n<p>See this lady over here? She’s a waitress. Pretty soon she could be replaced by a robot.</p>\n<p><strong>You think a robot would do a better job?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely. No question. And at much lower cost. The robot is always paying attention. It’s the same reason that the car is a better driver than the drivers are. So can she be replaced by a robot? Absolutely. We are fairly close.</p>\n<p><strong>Should you tip a robot?</strong></p>\n<p>Why do you tip people? You tip them for their service, you tip them out of a humanitarian sense of helping to provide for another human being. Would you tip a robot? My answer is no.</p>\n<p><strong>If I didn’t tip, the robot might shoot a laser at me. Or hack my credit records.</strong></p>\n<p>In my next book, I ask if are we going to have to bribe robots to do the work. Because that’s really possible. In that sense, you might tip a robot.</p>\n<p><strong>I would <em>over</em> tip a robot.</strong></p>\n<p>Well, if you came in here everyday, if the robot is busy it should serve you first if it knows it will get a bigger tip. So I’m walking back my answer. It depends on the circumstances. I wouldn’t tip a robot for humanitarian reasons. I would tip it for service reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you agree with the letter signed by Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking that asked for limits of robotic research</strong></p>\n<p>I wrote an opinion piece and gave it to the Times, titled “<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/opinion/robot-weapons-whats-the-harm.html?_r=0' title='' rel=''>Why I Didn’t Sign That Letter.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Hawking is a smart guy, shouldn’t we listen to him?</strong></p>\n<p>He’s a physicist, what does he know about this stuff? No offense, but it’s like Dr. Seuss talking about foreign policy. Let’s at least be open to the possibility that he is wrong or maybe he’s a little misguided.</p>\n<p><strong>What in that letter do you disagree with?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s overkill to say we should stop all research. They said we should ban autonomous weapons that are not under meaningful human control. It sounds good, but [the issue is] way more subtle.</p>\n<p><strong>When you look at the future, do you think that AI will be a plus or minus for humanity?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a very powerful technology. It has not only the possibility but the strong likelihood of having very important and positive economic effects. We have the ability and a responsibility to make sure that it’s channeled toward social and intellectual goals. The Silicon Valley view is, there is nothing to worry about — it’s only good, there’s no bad. That’s not true. We need to be thoughtful about the policies we put into place and we will need lots of controls. In order to get the value out of this without dehumanizing us and separating us and increasing inequality, lots of issues need to get solved, some of which are moral and ethical and some of which are just social. We need to be talking about that. We kind of got stuck on, “The robots are coming to kill us.”</p>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>\n<p><strong>Will robots have agency?

His presence, as…	2015-07-20 18:40:00	52e1698f1277	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*u46IBl35cEmhxxcjpd0JCQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo Cred: www.matthewrmorris.com</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>My 11th grade law teacher is more memorable for his embodiment of teaching than any knowledge he actually conveyed to me. His presence, as a minority man of intellectual firmness, showed us young, minority males that we could be ourselves and still be taken seriously. His ways made me believe that you could cling to your identity while simultaneously yearning for an education. I think he was from Trinidad. He had a ponytail and talked to us students the way he probably talked to his friends on a Friday night after a few beers. He was fearless and he knew that working in an inner city afforded him the comfort of being himself and preaching the “real shit” that needed to be spoken to kids that were destined for a hard life of scrutiny and surveillance. He had been there before. He never said that to us, but we could feel it.</p>\n<p>So with <a href='http://www.matthewrmorris.com/teaching/ive-learned-four-years-teaching/' title='' rel=''>these two men, and my first year teaching partner</a>, I surmised an idea of what teaching is all about. And that is compassion, authenticity and a truthful acknowledgement of why you are there</p>\n<p>In my first few years, I witnessed many capable teachers. I saw many adults showing students how to write paragraphs properly, how to conduct scientific experiments in an engaging and academic fashion, and many adults who did a fanstastic job of teaching kids how to solve complex math problems. But I rarely saw teachers that students gravitated towards. These few teachers, that I previously shouted out, are the rare exception and they had a gift precisely because they went against the grain. In my opinion, it takes unbridled recognition “to know yourself” and to be able to exude this onto a set of children. I wish to emulate these people. Actually, if it were not for these people, I would have no passion for teaching.</p>\n<p>I am confident that there are many teachers out there who possess this gift. The trouble seems that many teachers are afraid to unbottle <em>this</em>. My call is for teachers to unbottle their true selves while in the classroom. The teachers that step through their classroom doors with this will and determination are the ones that students remember forever. They are the teachers that students learn from the most</p>\n<h4>How to do this.</h4>\n<p>It is so simple. Be you, you have your credentials. In this society, credentials get you to where you need to be. You also have passion. And passion takes you to the next echelon of “master teaching”. These teachers, probably not advised, have decided to take it upon themselves to engage in this practice. It is a dangerous practice because, as adults, we all have our experiences, our faults, and our discretions. But we also have the uncanny ability to talk to our students in a way that we would talk to our sons and daughters. And I think that is it. These teachers are so gravitating and so mesmerizing because they took their job as a true “calling” in the unadulterated sense of the word. They spoke, taught, and listened to students as if they were their own children. They taught and “advised” students the same way they would their daughters, sons, nieces, or nephews. These are the teachers we should use to teach apprentices how to teach. If we find these teachers, we unlock the magic of unbridled passion and confidence and we guide the light to our future. Our test scores will rise, but most importantly, our confidence in a generation will grow.</p>	2015-07-20 19:01:00.578444	2015-08-01 01:01:21.053563	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*u46IBl35cEmhxxcjpd0JCQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>My 11th grade law teacher is more memorable for his embodiment of teaching than any knowledge he actually conveyed to me.

I knew the grim ending to the story before I even clicked play on my iPhone, but the video hit me all the same</p>\n<p>I couldn’t sleep as I replayed the images and sounds in my mind of Sandra Bland speaking up for herself and facing brutal retaliation. But besides the face value horror of the video, I was hit with another sinking feeling in my stomach as a sensation of familiarity crashed over me.</p>\n<>Watch the video again. This time replace Sandra Bland with a twelve-year-old girl. Replace the lit cigarette with chewing gum. Replace the car with a desk. Replace the state trooper with a teacher.</>\n<p>One of the most sickening aspects of the video was the way it brought into clear focus what police brutality (as a mechanism of racism) is really about: the maintenance of power. Sandra Bland refused to subjugate herself to the power and authority of State Trooper Brian Encinia and it enraged him. His response was to threaten her and assault her until he felt his power was reasserted.</p>\n<p>Does this situation sound familiar? Have you ever seen a colleague lose their cool in the hallway? Or heard a booming yell through the thin school walls?</p>\n<p><strong>“I am a teacher and you are a student! I am an adult and you are a child!”</strong></p>\n<p>Of course all adults will lose their tempers from time to time. It’s a part of being human. Teachers aren’t exempt from fallibility.</p>\n<p>But there’s something more at play than just kids mouthing off and adults “raising their voice”, something different and more nefarious. When we examine the role of race in our interactions with students we must acknowledge the role of power. White teachers working in schools with majority Black and/or Latino students must open our eyes to the power dynamic that’s more than just teacher/student, but also white/non-white and state/citizen.</p>\n<p>Let’s return to the revised Sandra Bland scenario once more. It’s independent work time in your classroom and everyone is supposed to be working silently. You notice Sandra whispering to her neighbor and so you move towards her.</p>\n<p><strong>“Sandra, stop talking. Get back to work.”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>“I wasn’t doing nothing! I was just askin’ Carlos for a pencil!”</strong></p>\n<p>She smacks her gum loudly to punctuate her response.</p>\n<p>Your student is talking back, and now your power is challenged. Meanwhile layer on to this an impulse to <a href='https://medium.com/@chanda/what-s-the-harm-in-tone-policing-e933d90af247' title='' rel=''>tone polic</a>e as your student’s use of <a href='http://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/aave.html' title='' rel=''>African American Vernacular English</a> presents another subconscious challenge to the dominant culture of your classroom. How do you respond</p>\n<p>Maybe Sandra is a straight-A student who’s acting out because she’s bored. Maybe she’s struggling just to pass and she’s frustrated. Does it matter?</p>\n<p>White people generally, and white educators specifically, need to recognize that ending racism doesn’t end with stopping police brutality. Rather we need to take a hard look in the mirror at our own privilege and our own practices. We can’t pretend that we don’t wield the “<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/291810-for-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house' title='' rel=''>master’s tools</a>” with just as much deftness and deadliness as police officers.

Maybe it escalates into a shouting match? After she slams her desk down do you send her to the Dean’s office where she’ll face an in-school suspension? And what happens on the day she returns? What lessons has she learned about who has the power in your classroom, your school and the world, and who does not? Whose voice matters and whose does not?</p>\n<p>Is this an ending we’re okay with?

The specific disruption centered around the Democratic candidates’ hesitance with delving into the country’s deep racial divide in a direct and truly progressive manner. By prompting politicians to use the words “black lives matter” over “all lives matter,” activists hope to invoke a better conversation around race and policing across the country.</p>\n<p>This type of disruption has been needed for some time in the education sphere, and <a href='http://educolor.org' title='' rel=''>#EduColor is it</a></p>\n<p>The premise of education reform debate has often been “What are we going to do about these children of color?” Schools are failing, failing, failing, and we have to throw all sorts of shortcuts at schools with mostly students of color at it because that’s the thing to do. In education reform world, it’s simultaneously true that there’s nothing we can do to really fix schools because these poor kids can’t make it out of their habitual squalor because they’re poor and of color. Everything’s going against them and so why bother to try things that work like integration and wraparound services?</p>\n<p>This sort of centering has often become unreasonable because it always finds ways to either strip agency from the very people whom it’s supposed to help or mascots them to the point of destruction. When’s the last time we heard Native Americans speak on their education and the sorts of reforms imposed on them by the government? When’s the last time we actually asked Black students what they thought about their education without the filter of a multimillion dollar political action committee? How often do we get to hear from Latino students and the disparate views one might have living in Washington Heights in New York City versus Rio Grande Valley in South Texas?</p>\n<p>And when education reform goes down, why does the person who speaks for or against the reform <em>have </em>to be white</p>\n<p>The leaders and opponents all over education debate stand in stark opposition to the population of our public schools, where the majority of the students are of color. Everyone from the most corrupt and money-seeking politician to the most well-meaning sociologist can have malignant blind spots towards issues of race, and how they affect everyone from the president to a pre-schooler.</p>\n<p>Insert #EduColor.</p>\n<p>In the couple of years since #EduColor began, we’ve seen a steady nudging of union leaders, scholars, and even the US Secretary of Education speak on issues of race with more vigor than in prior years. The protests behind the murders of Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Aiyana Jones, and Tamir Rice might have nudged them to speak up on the humanity of the school-aged children who our teachers see daily. This #EduColor conversation hasn’t just seeped into the higher branches of our institutions, but also (and finally) into classrooms, where teachers (including myself) have had to do plenty of reflection on the role we play in understanding and empathizing with the students in front of us.</p>\n<p>Yet, we can’t settle, and can never settle.</p>\n<p>Assuring all students have equitable resources to succeed in the spaces they occupy will demand more from all key stakeholders than ever before. We can’t just stick to the usual talking points about children of color, but resonate with the experiences of the students in front of us. We must learn how to take research seriously, and contextual experience just as seriously. We must learn how to work with children as children first, students second. We must proffer critical pedagogy because we need people who can think about the world in larger dimensions than a-b-c-d.</p>\n<p>The most radical thing we can do is not to choose between two sides, but critically engage all sides of the education debate in the hopes of finding what’s truly in the best interest of our students.

Aubrey is the Research Director and Kelsey is an Associate at Digital Promise.	2015-07-27 18:47:51	1dab8d88d382	<h3>Three Ways to Help Teachers Use Research</h3>\n<p><em>This post is written by Aubrey Francisco and Kelsey Gross. Aubrey is the Research Director and Kelsey is an Associate at Digital Promise.</em></p>\n<p>Teachers are in the business of learning. It makes sense, then, that many consider themselves lifelong learners, and are motivated to find new research-based solutions to improve their practice. Lillian Carroll, special education teacher at <a href='http://www.digitalpromise.org/districts/horry-county-schools' title='' rel=''>Horry County Schools, S.C.</a>, told us, “I work in a very diverse, research driven field. I cannot do my job without research. I have to stay up to date in my field because new findings are constantly coming out.</p>\n<p>Yet, teachers tell us they lack the time and confidence to sift through the overwhelming amount of research online, and analyze and adapt findings to their unique group of students. This results in missed opportunities to find and implement practices that could improve student learning.</p>\n<p>As we talked with educators at our <a href='http://www.digitalpromise.org/researchsummit' title='' rel=''>Research Summit</a> and in our <a href='http://www.digitalpromise.org/league' title='' rel=''>League of Innovative Schools</a>, we heard a recurring theme: teachers (and innovation) thrive in a “culture of data” where research use is encouraged, and staff are given opportunities to build their research skills. Administrators play a key role in fostering this culture throughout the district</p>\n<p>Based on feedback from educators, here are three ways administrators and district leaders can build a culture of research:</p>\n<h3>#1: Identify a Research Champion</h3>\n<p>While all educators can benefit from basic skills in analyzing research and data, not every teacher needs to be an expert. Instead, districts can identify a research leader or “champion.” According to <a href='http://www.workingoutwhatworks.com/en-GB/Magazine/2014/9/Why_every_school_needs_a_research_champion' title='' rel=''>ResearchED</a>, a research champion can connect teachers with research and “make it easy for classroom teachers to be more informed about what they do.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href='http://www.digitalpromise.org/blog/entry/how-districts-benefit-from-conducting-their-own-research' title='' rel=''>Eian Harm</a> is <a href='http://www.digitalpromise.org/districts/meridian-joint-school-district-no-2' title='' rel=''>West Ada School District</a>’s Research and Special Projects Coordinator. He helps teachers find research and collect data to solve challenges in their classrooms, and assess the effectiveness of new approaches. Externally, he coordinates partnerships with universities and research organizations interested in doing research in district schools. He makes sure all projects align with the district’s overall mission and strategy, which allows administrators to inform stakeholders how data informs decisions</p>\n<p>If a formal staff position is not possible, districts can still find creative ways to identify an informal “research champion.” As Summit participant Bart Epstein told us, “There are always a couple of teachers in the school who really love data, and they want to dive into it. Those teachers play a really important role in helping to translate the sometimes arcane academic findings into intelligible findings that their peers can use.”</p>\n<h3>#2: Foster Research Communities</h3>\n<p>In addition to having a “research champion” to support their work, teachers want opportunities to build communities with colleagues interested in similar research questions. Carroll advocates for “creating some kind of common platform where we could help each other by sharing our information on how we incorporated research into practice.” Administrators can foster either in-person or virtual communities for district teachers to share research resources and expertise.</p>\n<p>Additionally, administrators can model a community approach to research at the district level by building research partnerships. Several League districts regularly partner with local universities to conduct research. Research organizations are also an option, such as <a href='http://www.edutopia.org/about/lucas-education-research' title='' rel=''>Lucas Education Research</a>, <a href='http://www.gse.harvard.edu/course/yearlong-2014-2015/h156-research-schools-yearlong-2014-2015' title='' rel=''>Harvard Research Schools</a>, the <a href='http://ccsr.uchicago.edu/about' title='' rel=''>University of Chicago Consortium on Chicago School Research</a>, <a href='http://www.hanoverresearch.com/?i=k-12-education' title='' rel=''>Hanover Research</a>, and <a href='http://www.hanoverresearch.com/?i=k-12-education' title='' rel=''>Regional Educational Laboratories</a> (RELs)</p>\n<p>With the support of a partner organization, administrators could also consider <a href='http://learndbir.org/' title='' rel=''>Design-Based Implementation Research</a>, which involves teachers, students, parents, and community members in research projects that address current challenges in the district. Collaborative projects that involve all stakeholders can go a long way to creating a culture where innovation can flourish</p>\n<h3>#3: Support Skill Development</h3>\n<p>Educational technology tools provide more student data and options for classroom research than ever before. To take advantage of these tools, many teachers need to build new skills in data collection and analysis, and research implementation. Serena Hicks, a teacher at West Ada, <a href='http://www.digitalpromise.org/blog/entry/teachers-as-researchers-the-power-of-mindset' title='' rel=''>wrote about</a> how her colleagues felt intimidated by research. She encouraged them to experiment with <a href='http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/100047/chapters/What-Is-Action-Research%C2%A2.aspx' title='' rel=''>action research methods</a> by developing their own research questions, collecting data, and using what they learn to guide their teaching. Administrators can support teachers’ grassroots research efforts by showcasing and recognizing their work, and incorporating it into the evaluation process</p>\n<p>Administrators can also support teachers’ formal professional development in research skills. First, as key stakeholders, they can advocate for expanded research curricula in college and university teacher preparation programs. In this way, future teachers and those pursuing graduate studies will gain stronger skills in conducting and applying research. Second, as a more flexible option, summit participants recommended developing research literacy micro-credentials, which would identify research competencies each teacher could develop at his or her own pace. Through these <a href='http://www.digitalpromise.org/initiatives/educator-micro-credentials' title='' rel=''>micro-credentials</a>, as well as others on topics like data literacy, teachers could gain recognition for their research skills and help spread a culture of data use within their schools and districts</p>\n<p>Finally, administrators can lead by example and build their own skills in data use and research. According to Harm, “Administrators have a tough job. They need to take research findings and data, and inspire people with it, and take action.” Administrators who are confident in their research skills can use data as evidence to rally public support. Further, they can more confidently support teachers, and make the most of relationships with research partners.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of a Research Culture</h3>\n<p>Through these three steps, administrators can position districts to take full advantage of the ever-growing body of knowledge about student success. Summit attendee Michael Jay cites the importance of building teachers’ research skills, but adds that administrators need to trust “an educator who is tuned into student learning and can really read the student about what’s working, what’s not.” Empowering teachers and staff across the district to combine their wisdom and intuition with research yields powerful results.</p>\n<p><em>In June 2015, Digital Promise gathered educators, technology developers, and researchers to identify ways to put research to work to improve learning outcomes for all students. <a href='http://www.digitalpromise.org/researchsummit' title='' rel=''>Learn more about our discussions</a>.</em></p>\n<><a href='http://www.digitalpromise.org/forum/entry/how-do-you-use-research' title='' rel=''>How do you use research?</a>\nLet us know below or check out our forum</>\n<p><em>Originally published at <a href='http://www.digitalpromise.org/blog/entry/three-ways-to-help-teachers-use-research' title='' rel=''>www.digitalpromise.org</a>.</em></p>	2015-07-23 03:01:11.025789	2015-07-27 19:01:13.181032	<h3>Three Ways to Help Teachers Use Research</h3>\n<p><em>This post is written by Aubrey Francisco and Kelsey Gross.

In this encounter, Jia asks the manager, Jackie, of Krispy Kreme to make a set of doughnuts in the shape of the Olympic rings expecting to be rejected. Instead, she goes to work and fulfills his request. Take a moment to watch the clip</p>\n<p>Jia Jiang, in <a href='http://readtoleadpodcast.com/episode-085-fear-rejection-jia-jiang-and-jeff-brown-of-read-to-lead-podcast' title='' rel=''>his interview</a> with <a href='http://readtoleadpodcast.com/about' title='' rel=''>Jeff Brown </a>on <a href='http://readtoleadpodcast.com/' title='' rel=''>ReadtoLead </a>podcast states that this encounter made him wonder how many opportunities he had missed because of his fear. How often do we pass on asking, trying, doing, seeing because of our own fear</p>\n<p><strong>Fear Keeps Us from Exploring</strong></p>\n<p>In <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Multipliers-Best-Leaders-Everyone-Smarter-ebook/dp/B003M69A4Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1436746584&sr=1-1&keywords=Multipliers' title='' rel=''><em>Multipliers</a> </em>Lis Wiseman explores how certain people, whom she calls<em> Multipliers</em>, get more from the people around them, multiplying the effect of their efforts</p>\n<><em>They don’t see a world where just a few people deserve to do the thinking; Multipliers see intelligence as continually developing. This observation is consistent with what Dweck calls a “growth mindset,” which is a belief that basic qualities like intelligence and ability can be cultivate through effort. They assume: </em>people are smart and will figure it out. <em>They see their organization as full of talented people who are capable of contributing at much higher levels.</em></>\n<p>Yet most people end up not using most of their capabilities, stuck in a situation where their talent is not being used to its full capacity, they are unhappy with what they are doing but fear making a change to do something else. In a recent study <a href='http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx' title='' rel=''>Gallup Study</a>, 63% of employees were disengaged in their workplace. This has many implication</p>\n<><em>People spend a substantial part of their lives working, whether in a high-tech startup in Singapore, a financial institution in Australia, or a garment factory in the Dominican Republic. As a result, the quality of their workplace experience is inevitably reflected in the quality of their lives. Gallup’s finding that the vast majority of employees worldwide report an overall negative experience at work — and just one in eight are fully involved in and enthusiastic about their jobs — is important when considering why the global recovery remains sluggish, while social unrest abounds in many countries.</em></>\n<p>There are many <a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2013/01/18/why-are-so-many-employees-disengaged/' title='' rel=''>reasons given</a> for this happening in the workplace with a number of different ideas of how to <a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2013/09/02/why-are-70-of-employees-disengaged-and-what-can-you-do-about-it/' title='' rel=''>address</a> the situation. Similarly,<a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/gallup-education-report_n_5119966.html' title='' rel=''> recent studies</a> of teachers showed that up to 70% of teachers are not engaged at their work while <a href='http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/05/01/kappan_washor.html' title='' rel=''>studies of students </a>show a significant portion of <a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmarshallcrotty/2013/03/13/motivation-matters-40-of-high-school-students-chronically-disengaged-from-school/' title='' rel=''>students in high school </a>are disengaged.

They are risk-takers and innovators.</p>\n<><em>These people wander at the edge of possibility, creating wonder with others, not afraid to see what might be, undeterred by failure or mistakes; lifelong learners and co-creators, they are passionate and embrace the complexity of life not seeking reward but wishing only to make the world a better place than they found it.</em></>\n<p>We don’t all have to be raising money or campaigning although some people find that it fits. But, as I indicated in <a href='http://wp.me/p5i3kk-CU' title='' rel=''>my last post</a>, continuing to ignore the things taking place around us or hoping someone else will take the risk is not helping students address the issues they face today</p>\n<p>Jade Balleck, an educator who is now taking on the responsibility of being an administrator, takes the step of acknowledging that she needs to do more. Her post <a href='http://thelearninglens.blogspot.ca/2015/07/principals-short-course-part-2.html' title='' rel=''>Principal’s Short Course Part II </a>is a great example of someone not waiting to take a step forward but bolding stepping forward as she seeks to develop a deeper awareness of the need to be culturally aware as an administrator/educator</p>\n<p><strong>Allowing Ourselves to Be Artists</strong></p>\n<p>In <a href='http://www.amazon.ca/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591844096' title='' rel=''>Linchpin</a>, Seth Godin describes how it is possible to become a person that is necessary, a linchpin, not by doing what everyone else is doing but by being creative at what you are doing, to seeing a problem and beginning to solve that problem. Become the linchpin that holds things together. In doing this, Godin explains that there are choices we have to make about how we approach work and what we decide to do at work. At one point, in discussing the topic of labour, specifically emotional labour, Godin explain</p>\n<><em>The essence of any gift, including the gift of emotional labor, is that you don’t do it for a tangible, guaranteed reward. If you do, it’s no longer a gift; it’s a job.</em></>\n<p>Labour as a gift? Working to make a change in the world without worrying about whether you get rewarded? As children, helping others without expecting a reward is something that we often learn from parents or people around us. Somewhere along the way the intrinsic nature of doing something without expecting a reward is often replaced as we seek to get something for our efforts, recognized for what we are doing.</p>\n<p>In <a href='http://www.amazon.ca/Invisibles-Power-Work-Relentless-Self-Promotion/dp/159184634X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437507377&sr=1-1&keywords=the+Invisibles+David+Zweig' title='' rel=''>Invisibles- The Power of Anonymous Work</a> David Zweig looks at how those people who, although anonymous to most of the world, are indeed necessary and highly respected by the people who know them within their industry. These people are linchpins in their industr</p>\n<><em>…highly skilled, and people whose roles are critical to whatever enterprise they are a part of. … often highly successful and recognized by, indeed deeply respected among their co-workers for their expertise and performance… [they] have </em>chosen, <em>or fallen into and then decided to stay in, careers that accord them no outward recognition from the end user. This is defiantly in opposition to the accolades, or even just pats on the back, most of us desire. And yet — Invisible are an exceptionally satisfied lot.</em></>\n<p><strong>What drives them?</strong></p>\n<p>A passion for the work they do, a desire to make things better, and a meticulousness that fuels their passion. In the interviews and discussions Zweig has with these people throughout the book, it becomes apparent that these people are drawn to make a difference without a need to be recognized. According to Zweig, these people exhibit three common traits:</p>\n<><em>1) Ambivalence toward recognition</em></>\n<><em>2) Meticulousness</em></>\n<><em>3) Savoring of responsibility</em></>\n<p>As an educator and administrator, these traits are similar to those I have seen in educators with whom I have worked. Unfortunately, they rarely are afforded the last — responsibility. In classrooms and schools, there are people who are doing meticulous work trying to do what’s best for the students in their rooms/schools but lack the opportunity to demonstrate their responsibility. They have an incredible passion for what they are doing — without it they wouldn’t be able to continue. Yet, too often, they are frustrated and constrained by those around them.</p>\n<p>Many people choose to remain doing what they are doing, even if they are unhappy and don’t like it, because fear of the unknown and what might happen, the possibility of failure and the pain associated with that failure are much greater than their desire to change what is happening. Making a change is difficult, in some cases it requires us to learn new things or to maybe admit we weren’t as good as we thought we were at what we were doing.</p>\n<p><strong>I Wonder…..</strong></p>\n<p>Just this week I had a great conversation about change, fear and innovation. During the conversation I mentioned that at one point I had switched to tables in the classroom and removed my teacher desk. A common response from teachers is that they rarely use their desk or sit at it, it’s just a place to keep their stuff. So I challenge them to remove it and see how it frees them to envision their classroom space differently, to envision their role in the classroom differently, to begin to revise the flow, the interactions and the space. It brings a change to the classroom that other educators can sense when they walk in. Something is just different.</p>\n<p>….. what keeps each of us from being able to bring about change? What if each teacher wrote their fears down and began to address them? What if we shared and worked together, helping each other?</p>\n<p>….. recognition isn’t necessarily a motivator but being given responsibility is. According to Liz Wiseman, author of <a href='http://www.amazon.ca/The-Multiplier-Effect-Tapping-Schools/dp/1452271895' title='' rel=''>The Multiplier Effect</a>, leaders who expect people around them to do great things and then give them the responsibility to do so multiply the effects of the people with whom they lead. What would happen if teachers were given responsibility, not for grades and assessment, but learning and growth, for supporting their students to make the world a better place</p>\n<p>…. why many school leaders are so enthralled with data that dehumanizes the learning relationship?</p>\n<p>…. what data can tell us that a great teacher with strong relationships can’t?</p>\n<p>…. why schools are so afraid of risk-taking and innovations if learning takes place in the space of discomfort between what we know and what we want to know, which may, in fact, include failure?</p>	2015-07-22 03:00:52.211081	2015-08-03 17:01:41.448421	<></>\n<p>The power of one.</p>
87	6	Segregation and its impacts on Latino education and earnings	By Anne Kim	2015-07-21 17:48:12	32b6f0b64015	<p></p>\n<h3>Segregation and its impacts on Latino education and earnings</h3>\n<p><em>By Anne Kim</em></p>\n<p>Latinos are America’s largest, fastest growing — and perhaps most geographically concentrated — group.</p>\n<p>According to the Census Bureau, <a href='http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2011/dec/c2010br-04.pdf' title='' rel=''>more than half</a> of the nation’s <a href='http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/facts-for-features/2014/cb14ff-22_hispanic.pdf' title='' rel=''>54 million</a> Latinos live in just three states — California, Texas, and Florida. The <a href='http://www.pewhispanic.org/2013/08/29/mapping-the-latino-population-by-state-county-and-city/' title='' rel=''>Pew Research Center</a> reports that the nation’s 100 largest counties by Latino population also include 71 percent of all Latinos</p>\n<p>While some <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3226926/' title='' rel=''>research</a> argues for an “enclave effect” that benefits minorities who live together, a new <a href='http://ann.sagepub.com/content/660/1/57.full.pdf+html' title='' rel=''>study</a> from researchers at New York University’s <a href='http://furmancenter.org/' title='' rel=''>Furman Center</a> finds worrisome impacts associated with increasing Latino segregation in major metropolitan areas. In particular, the researchers find a direct correlation between higher levels of segregation and lower rates of education and job market success</p>\n<p>“The most striking correlations are on earnings,” says the study’s lead author Justin Steil, a legal research fellow at the Furman Center. For example, Steil says, Latinos living in the nation’s most segregated city — Los Angeles — earn 17 percent less in comparison to whites than Latinos living in the somewhat less segregated Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>Latinos living in Los Angeles are also 5.4 percent less likely to graduate from high school than Latinos living in Las Vegas and are 10.8 percent less likely to finish college in comparison to whites. And among younger Latinos ages 25 to 30, living in Los Angeles is associated with a 4.6 percentage increase in the likelihood of “disconnection” — neither working nor in school.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/0*ZE8LBvD3SFlD-5Lb.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The study also finds that the negative effects associated with segregation among Latino communities is in some instances worse than the negative impacts associated with segregation in African-American communities.</p>\n<p>For instance, while the difference in black-white segregation rates between less-segregated Phoenix and highly-segregated New Orleans is about the same as the difference in Latino-white segregation rates between Las Vegas and Los Angeles, there’s a smaller comparative drop in high school graduation rates — 2.4 percent versus 5.4 percent. Similarly, the likelihood of single motherhood is comparatively lower for African-American women living in New Orleans than for Latina women living in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>For both African-American and Latino communities, however, the same negative forces are in play when segregation is greater. “The quality of life in a neighborhood is profoundly shaped by the availability and the quality of public services that are delivered, from schooling to public safety to sanitation,” write Steil and his colleagues, Jorge De la Roca and Ingrid Gould Ellen.</p>\n<p><strong>Top 10 most segregated metro areas, by Latino-white segregation</strong></p>\n<>Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, CA</>\n<>New York-White Plains-Wayne, NY-NJ</>\n<>Newark-Union, NJ-PA</>\n<>Boston-Quincy, MA</>\n<>Salinas, CA</>\n<>Philadelphia, PA</>\n<>Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL</>\n<>Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA</>\n<>Santa Ana-Anaheim-Irvine, CA</>\n<>Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, TX</>\n<p><strong>Top 10 most segregated metro areas, by Black-white segregation</strong></p>\n<>Detroit-Livonia-Dearborn, MIC</>\n<>Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, WI</>\n<>New York-White Plains-Wayne, NY-NJ</>\n<>Newark-Union, NJ-PA</>\n<>Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL</>\n<>Philadelphia, PA</>\n<>Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall, FL</>\n<>Cleveland-Elyria-Mentor, OH</>\n<>St. Louis, MO-IL</>\n<>Nassau-Suffolk, NY</>\n<p>Highly segregated communities, for example, may have higher rates of violence, unequal access to crucial governmental services, poorer-performing schools and lower rates of “institutional density” — meaning fewer banks and high-quality grocery stores, as well as fewer community organizations, childcare centers and other resources that can help connect people to jobs and other opportunities. Segregated communities may also suffer deficits in human capital — such as college-educated adults who can mentor children and serve as role models. <a href='http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/brown-at-60-great-progress-a-long-retreat-and-an-uncertain-future/Brown-at-60-051814.pdf' title='' rel=''>Research</a> finds that being around college-educated adults is directly linked to higher odds for a young person’s own academic success</p>\n<p>While there’s some evidence that the Latino population is dispersing across the country as it grows, other evidence indicates that Latino segregation is worsening. Steil and his colleagues find, for example, that average levels of Latino isolation — e.g., the likelihood that Latinos live in neighborhoods with other Latinos — now matches that of African-Americans.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/0*zNhqOJJz4_dcncuO.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Other research finds that Latino segregation is particularly acute in public schools. For example, a 2014 <a href='http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/brown-at-60-great-progress-a-long-retreat-and-an-uncertain-future/Brown-at-60-051814.pdf' title='' rel=''>report</a> by UCLA’s Civil Rights Project found that “the typical Latino student is now in a school that is 57 [percent] Latino, more segregated than black students are with fellow blacks and second only to whites in the level of in-group isolation.”; Moreover, the report finds, among schools where the super-majority of students are black and Latino, the super-majority are also likely to be living in poverty</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the Obama Administration <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/us/hud-issuing-new-rules-to-fight-segregation.html?_r=0' title='' rel=''>announced</a> new fair housing rules, requiring cities and localities to detail how they would use federal funds to combat segregation. And in June, the Supreme Court <a href='http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/25/417433460/in-fair-housing-act-case-supreme-court-backs-disparate-impact-claims' title='' rel=''>held</a> that the 1968 Fair Housing Act allows claims for “disparate impact.” This means that plaintiffs can sue for housing discrimination without having to prove that the discrimination was intentional, so long as the impacts are shown to be discriminatory</p>\n<p>“These are important tools for addressing continuing levels of housing segregation and trying to address the policies that contribute to that segregation,” says NYU researcher Steil.</p>\n<p>These efforts, however, are just part of the solutions necessary to combat segregation and its damaging impacts. Steil’s research implies that better quality schools, improvements in college readiness and affordability, and better access to promising workforce development initiatives, such as apprenticeships, are equally important.</p>\n<p>By <a href='http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/facts-for-features/2014/cb14ff-22_hispanic.pdf' title='' rel=''>2060</a>, the Census Bureau projects, fully 31 percent of America’s population will be Latino.

The future of education…	2015-08-03 00:43:04	7f31b620434d	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*d2bolpJQGCkpItKaBTPGEQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Image by Flickr user: woodleywonderworks, 2009. First Grade Reading.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Myths in the education system are important to debunk in order to build a better support system for students. The future of education depends on looking at past failures, and not just learning from them to move forward, but to rise upwards. There are several myths in English Language classrooms that are often seen as normal practice.</p>\n<p>Identifying these myths will help us meet our students’ needs, and be able to serve them better.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth #1: Students cannot use their first language in the classroom</strong></p>\n<p>There are still many teachers who enforce this rule in their classrooms despite the fact the it is outdated and has many negative effects on the learner. When students are able to use their first language amongst peers who also speak the same language, they are more likely to use English for communicative purposes in social settings. Another reason to allow students’ use of first language in the classroom is for them to understand instructions fully. In this way, the student is able to concentrate on the task at hand, rather than being preoccupied with trying to understand the instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth #2: Students need to be corrected when they’re speaking English</strong></p>\n<p>It is often tempting for teachers to correct grammar or pronunciation when student is speaking. However, it’s best to let the students speak freely without the interfering act of correcting. Correcting often decreases students’ self-confidence and diminishes their agency and voice in the classroom. Over time, with lots of practice of oral communication, students will eventually recognize grammar and sentence structure patterns on their own. In the meantime, teachers should support students when speaking by offering help when the student asks for it. Corrective strategies in the classroom, if at all necessary, need to be done privately, with kindness and care.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth #3: All English language learners are immigrants</strong></p>\n<p>Many language learners are not immigrants and have in fact been born in the US. Some language learners are also international students, who are here on a study period. It is important to be mindful and empathetic to the backgrounds of our learners to help us meet their learning needs and create a safe classroom culture for them.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth #4: To learn English students must assimilate within North American culture</strong></p>\n<p>To assimilate is to change or acquire certain characteristics of a group. Many teachers are under the impression that in order for students to succeed in language acquisition, a student must adopt and assimilate in North American culture. It is important to remember that the two processes are completely separate from each other.</p>\n<p>Students can and do learn the language regardless whether they assimilate to North American culture practices or not. Understanding that the two processes are unrelated will help teachers be supportive of the student’s learning of the new culture and its practices and ideologies. In this way the teachers can act as a support system to help the student navigate new cultural understandings and help them make sense of what is usually an overwhelming experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth #5: All English language learners share similar background, culture, socio-economic status</strong></p>\n<p>This might seem like an obvious myth, however, often times teachers unconsciously view English language learners as a collective of students. It is absolutely crucial to shift this mindset and focus on the student from an individualistic perspective. English language learners are often so different from each other that they do not relate to their peers for the simple fact that they are both ELLs. Reminding ourselves that our language learners do not share the same culture, religion, socio-economic background, race, etc. helps us see them as the special individuals that they are. Connect with students by knowing who they are, it is the only way to touch their minds and their hearts.</p>\n<p><em>This post was originally published on <a href='http://www.edutopia.org/discussion/debunking-myths-english-language-learners' title='' rel=''>Edutopia</a>.</em></p>	2015-08-03 01:01:15.640712	2015-08-06 15:00:57.725341	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*d2bolpJQGCkpItKaBTPGEQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Myths in the education system are important to debunk in order to build a better support system for students.

It would require the “public announcement of a grant award be accompanied by a non-technical explanation of the project’s scientific merits and how it serves the national interest.</p>\n<h4>It always makes me laugh when politicians aren’t the slightest bit embarrassed to admit that they need non-technical terms from the experts in order to make decisions that are going to negatively affect those experts and quite possibly, everyone else.</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>I really have no place to comment on how much money tax payers should be spending on research and grants. I have greatly benefited from public grants in Austria and Switzerland to do research in the social sciences and to teach, but I don’t know if I could make an absolute claim about the national interest of my work.</p>\n<p>What I can say absolutely is that the funding I’ve received to do research or work abroad has influenced <em>me</em>; it has helped <em>me </em>understand the world through different lenses; it has help <em>me</em> entertain the idea of cultural diplomacy and peace through understanding…and…</p>\n<p><em>blah, blah, blah. What a bunch of mushy nonsense that is all selfish. Me, me, me!</em></p>\n<p>Right?</p>\n<p>Wrong.</p>\n<p>I take this newfound knowledge and perspective and pass it onto the dozens of students I interact with through my counseling; I pass it onto the colleagues I meet with and present to at conferences; I pass it onto my fellow graduate students; I pass it onto my family; I pass it onto my two-year-old daughter…</p>\n<p>Learning and research should be selfish because in the end, they never remain selfish.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lsZ38Q6DjA-EXoCkcwRP0A.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Doug Robichaud</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h3>Knowledge can’t be contained. It oozes out of even the most closed minds.</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The real problem is not the sharing of information; the real problem is restricting the acquisition of information based on political or economic interests.</p>\n<p>We like to think that when the government funds research it is non-biased and for the good of the people, but when private industry funds it, it is to fuel the greedy capitalist machine.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, government backstage is filled with people who are generalists — enterprising generalists — who know how to move a crowd, garner support and move money around, but not much about any one thing, in particular. We somehow grant them the authority to make laws about topics about which they have very little, if any, knowledge. Hence, we get requests for keeping it simple, proving the validity of your research topic in as few words as possible, speaking in layman’s terms and doing only that which is practical, relevant, and yes, lucrative.</p>\n<p>In this case, specifically, we see an attack on the “soft” sciences, as people call them. After all, social science isn’t real science, is it? Even if our congressmen are requesting non-technical explanations of our work, our science isn’t really “technical” science, is it? And if it’s not technical, as in dealing with the manufacturing of drugs, weapons and maybe a new spaceship, then what good could it possibly serve?</p>\n<p>I’ll leave you with a statement from the National Science Foundation, which I think sums up the answer quite nicely:</p>\n<>We live in extraordinary times, benefiting from unprecedented discovery and innovation. The complexities of national needs escalate with the pace of globalization and communication. As our population expands and becomes more diverse, our quality of life increasingly depends on understanding human factors that can better sustain our environment, prevent illness, maintain a robust economy, curtail conflict and advance democracy.

The multi-week “summer intensive” is designed by districts in partnership with NYC Leadership Academy’s (NYCLA) to prepare school leaders for the rigors of the principal or other leadership roles by inserting them into simulated situations commonly experienced on the job.</p>\n<p>From angry parent meetings, to teacher evaluations, to curriculum and professional development planning, to school board meetings and more, the summer intensive develops the leadership skills and reflective stances new principals need to build capacity and improve student outcomes.</p>\n<>“If you can’t get through summer intensive then you shouldn’t be a principal,” says Danika Rux, a NYC APP graduate and current Field Support Liaison at the New York City Department of Education.</>\n<p>“That experience will tell you whether or not you have what it takes to get through the rest of the program. That intensity is what it takes to turn a school around,” Rux said.</p>\n<p>In a school with 98 percent of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch, Principal Rux led her school from an “F” on the NYC Department of Education’s Progress Report to an “A” in four years, proving that low-income doesn’t have to mean low-performing.</p>\n<p>For 13 years, NYCLA’s <a href='http://www.nycleadershipacademy.org/programs-and-services/aspiring-leaders-programs/aspiring-principals-program/index' title='' rel=''>Aspiring Principals Program (APP)</a> has prepared, supported and graduated more than 500 aspiring New York City public school leaders, who went on to lead high-need schools or to take on leadership positions supporting these schools. The APP program is an important part of a bigger portfolio of NYCLA’s leadership development programs and services, which have expanded to 26 states and several countries</p>\n<p>This summer, <a href='http://www.nycleadershipacademy.org/programs-and-services/aspiring-leaders-programs/aspiring-principals-program/index' title='' rel=''>aspiring principals and leaders</a> from Cleveland, New York City, and a national cohort from a group of parochial schools funded by the Commonweal Foundation are taught by some of the most highly experienced facilitators in the field. These new school leaders are put through the paces of typical school days, while honing a vision and plan that will set them up for success as new leaders</p>\n<p>“The reason the APP summer intensive is so important for today’s school leader is that it gives real experience in a safe environment. You get to make mistakes and have someone provide feedback in real time. And you practice the skills needed for situational problem solving,” Rux said. “When you go through traditional university preparation programs, for example, you get content, but not the on-the-job training that medical doctors and other high-stakes professions receive.”</p>\n<p><a href='http://clevelandmetroschools.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=409&ModuleInstanceID=1887&ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=8739&PageID=1382' title='' rel=''>Speaking to participants in Cleveland Metropolitan School District’s (CMSD) Aspiring Principals Academy, </a>CEO Eric Gordon made it clear that expectations run high in a school district that believes school reform begins with building principals</p>\n<>“You have got to be great for my kids.” — <a href='http://clevelandmetroschools.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=409&ModuleInstanceID=1887&ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=8739&PageID=1382' title='' rel=''>Cleveland Metropolitan School District’s Aspiring Principals Academy, </a>CEO Eric Gordo</>\n<p>Gordon asked leaders to be “individually and collectively courageous.” He said the district aims to attract and develop principals who take risks but are not divisive mavericks who quickly flame out.</p>\n<p>CMSD received 184 applications for its 2015–16 aspiring principals academy and interviewed 65 applicants. Seven women and three men were chosen. The group is diverse, with three black members and two who are of Latino background.</p>\n<p>“We are very, very proud of this program and its success rate,” Gordon said.</p>\n<p>Following the summer intensive, participants will begin phase three of the APP program — a multi-month residency. Like a medical residency, the APP residency provides aspiring leaders with authentic opportunities to practice school leadership with the support of trained mentor principals and APP coaches.</p>\n<p>It is the experiential learning of a well-designed residency that enables an aspiring school leader to be more fully prepared for the vitally important and complex job of a school leader.</p>\n<p>Before assuming a leadership position in which they are responsible for a school, APP participants complete a planning phase tailored to their unique school community. The process ensures a strong start and a continued connection to their fellow APP cohort to share ideas and reflect on the challenges and opportunities of their profession. That’s why this kind of experiential, standards based learning is an unmatched professional opportunity of a lifetime.</p>\n<p>A principal’s first day on the job is not the time to negotiate competing priorities and respond to crises du jour while evaluating and guiding teaching practices.</p>\n<p>The summer intensive and the other APP components immerse aspiring principals in the daily rhythms of a school day in all of its non-stop action, high-energy, complicated, struggles and glory.</p>\n<>Through these intensive and deliberate experiences, leaders become adept at dealing with the challenges at hand and remain deeply focus on student learning.</>\n<p>Much is at stake. As NYCLA CEO Irma Zardoya states: “Schools are one of the most important places where we can change the tide of race, gender, ethnic and class inequities to build a country that truly embraces each human being having equal and inalienable rights.” That is NYCLA’s imperative and why programs like this one are crucial.</p>\n<p><em>For more information about programs for aspiring principals and leaders go to www.nycleadershipacademy.org</em></p>	2015-07-24 01:01:03.899238	2015-08-03 11:01:20.729151	<h3>School leaders from across the nation begin “Summer Intensives”</h3>\n<p></p>\n<h4><em>A professional experience of a lifetime</em></h4>

Even though authors like Bradbury and Asimov were writing about worlds that would exist during my lifetime, the allure of the possible was intoxicating. Earlier science fiction writers like Verne and Wells established a genre that pushed not only the limits of our technology but also what it meant to be truly “human”</p>\n<p>As a person that reads often, I have always adored these classic works of science fiction but have noticed that my own two sons, 13 and 9, have little interest in or access to contemporary science fiction. Sure, the genre hasn’t died but it has drastically morphed into a very formulaic view that the “future” is wrought with doom and gloom.</p>\n<p>This is what allows Weir’s <em>The Martian </em>to be so compelling. While the novel is centered on the conflict of survival, it revives the science fiction genre in 3 ways</p>\n<p><strong>It’s not dystopian.</strong></p>\n<p>Contemporary science fiction is mired in the downward spiral of human civilization. Science either is the cause of or the savior for humanity’s fate. In either case the options are depressing instead of inspiring. Hence the rise of dystopian science fiction, and our seemingly unquenchable thirst that forecast our inevitable destruction. I understand the purpose, the author’s intent, is to prognosticate a warning about humanity’s path. A “it’s not too late” alarm for our current generation, but the overwhelming saturation of these types of work convey a consensus rather than a warning. The outcome is destined instead of a choice.</p>\n<p>Weir’s novel portrays a future where space exploration, while still not a unified human endeavor and still impacted by geo-political concerns, is fundamentally woven into the fabric of our world. It’s not the result of a dying Earth (i.e. Interstellar) or the cause of Earth’s destruction. Space exploration is a natural extension of our human spirit: to go places where no one has ever been before. Weir accurately shows the reader a future world that continues to honor this basic human drive while also showing the reader a world functioning and not disintegrating.</p>\n<p><strong>Humanity can work together.</strong></p>\n<p>Another interesting trend in contemporary dystopian fiction is that the fate of humanity rests with the power of 1. Pick your favorite book series and more than likely the main character is charged with the task of rescuing all of us. The archetype is an ancient one, but the proliferation of this trope spotlights a modern movement, the power of the individual, or more accurately, the power of acting as a unique individual. Whether it’s <em>Hunger Games, Ender’s Game, </em>or <em>Divergent</em>, the whole of humanity has become lock step with some powerful overlord, but there is the chosen one that must save the rest of us</p>\n<p>While Weir’s novel does focus on the one character and his struggles, the story illustrates the best of humanity: our collective ability to work together to solve the unsolvable. Instead of using his novel to scare humanity into action, Weir creates a situation where humanity’s strengths are used to save each of us. Astronaut Mark Watney is our modern day representation of John Donne’s “No Man is an Island”. We all share a responsibility for each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Individuals are creators and are not subordinate to our technology.</strong></p>\n<p>A characteristic of our contemporary science fiction is the fact that we fear humanity will become servant to its creation, technology. While that argument is extremely valid and to a very real degree, we already are, in dystopian fiction our relationship with technology and science always leads us astray. It’s the fast track to our demise.</p>\n<p>There is a movement, that is gaining momentum, which Weir adeptly taps into, and it’s “the individual as maker”. Certainly our world has become populated with consumers. But the pendulum is swinging away from passive consumerism. Our kids want to create. Whether it’s structured “maker-spaces” in schools, playing <em>Minecraft </em>at home, or the resurgence of Lego, our next generation seems to be seeded in seeking satisfaction from ‘crafting’(as the gamers call it)</p>\n<p>Weir’s Watney is our next generation’s “everyman”. Again and again Watney reminds us he is just a botanist and he barely knows any chemistry, but he continually uses his skills, resources, and ingenuity to overcome insurmountable problems. While the novel is primarily his story, we see “everymen” working on Earth, using his/her own skills, resources, and ingenuity to overcome insurmountable problems. Imagine the potential of humanity if each of us embraced our primal “maker” selves within the context of our modern world.</p>\n<p>The two movements are not in conflict with each other. Making and science go hand-in-hand. It’s when the ‘making’ becomes the exclusive ability of the few that humanity disintegrates. Weir’s novel shows us a not-to-distant-future that rectifies these two ends.</p>	2015-07-24 17:01:10.389434	2015-07-24 17:01:10.389434	<p></p>\n<p>Andy <a href='https://twitter.com/andyweirauthor' title='' rel=''>Weir</a>’s bestselling science fiction novel <a href='http://andyweirauthor.com/books/the-martian-hc' title='' rel=''><em>The Martian</em></a> reminded me of the science fiction from the mid-twentieth century I read as a child.

97	7	The Number Line: A Powerful and Versatile Model	Aha! Moment	2015-07-23 21:02:44	344580a8cbbe	<h4>Aha! Moment</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>The number line is a powerful model that helps students develop flexibility in their thinking. Throughout the <em>Eureka Math</em> curriculum the number line is used to enable students to develop strong number sense and to recognize relationships among numbers. Early elementary students develop their thinking using manipulatives and the number path, which leads them to ultimately understand how to use the number line. The simplicity of the number line allows math students of all levels to develop an understanding of the relative magnitude and position of numbers. It’s also a strong aid in helping students work towards proficiency in visualizing operations. In this blog, I will illustrate how this model develops from Grade PK to Grade 6</p>\n<h4>Pre-K</h4>\n<p>In Grade PK, students learn to count the “math way” from 1 to 5, starting at their left pinky and moving towards their left thumb, which prepares them to count from 6 to 10 beginning with the right thumb and continuing to the right pinky.</p>\n\n<p>This prepares them for understanding the number path and the number line. In these early elementary years, students learn that numbers on the number line increase from left to right. The part of the number line to the left of zero isn’t addressed until much later.</p>\n<p>Students also discover the pattern of <em>1 more</em> through the development of number stairs for quantities of 1 to 5, realizing that as they move one step to the right, they are increasing the value by 1 more than they started</p>\n\n<h4>Grade K</h4>\n<p>In Grade K, students continue this idea that each successive number refers to a quantity that is one more than the previous number. They also recognize that the number before any given number is one less than that number, continuing the learning from PK where students broke down a tower of 5, removing one cube at a time while counting backwards. This understanding allows students to develop the idea of counting on rather than counting all, which begins in Grade K and develops further in Grade 1. Multiple opportunities are provided for students to develop their understanding of numbers and build intuitive strategies for solving addition and subtraction problems using the Rekenrek. This also aids in setting the foundation for students to understand the number line.</p>\n\n<h4>Grade 1</h4>\n<p>In Grade 1, students use the number path to solve various problems. In the problem below, students solve for the unknown part:</p>\n<>5 + ___ = 8</>\n<p>Students may start at 5, hop to 8 and determine there are 3 hops so the missing value is 3. After first determining the unknown to have a value of 3, students can then use the number path again to solve a related subtraction sentence, 8–5 = _____ and determine the unknown is 3.</p>\n\n<h4>Grade 2</h4>\n<p>The number line is first explicitly addressed in Grade 2 and is supported by the 20-bead Rekenrek. Students can see numbers to 10 as a number line and further develop their number sense. They begin working with the clock as a circular number line where the clock is made from a ribbon and marked at 12 points.</p>\n\n\n<p>Students count backward and forward in intervals of five and relate the place on the ribbon to time. In Grade 2, students also relate addition and subtraction to length and begin to use the ruler as a number line where they measure lengths of line segments, find the sum of both line segments and compare the lengths (see image below to the left).</p>\n<p>Towards the end of Grade 2, students draw and label a bar graph to represent data. They notice how the numbers on the graph help record data and also provide a tool that allows for a more efficient way of creating the graph, rather than counting each box to record the value in each category. Students also recognize the scale helps with more precise comparisons and relate the scale on the graph to the number line.</p>\n\n<h4>Grade 3</h4>\n<p>In Grade 3, students have many opportunities to use the number line to aid in strengthening their understanding of various math concepts.<strong> </strong>They build upon their knowledge in Grade 2 and use the number line in Eureka lessons to tell time to the nearest minute. They count by fives and ones and solve word problems involving time intervals within 1 hour by counting backward and forward. The number line is used as a tool to help add and subtract to solve word problems involving time intervals within 1 hour</p>\n\n<p>In addition, students use the number line to see fractions as numbers and begin using the interval from 0 to 1, where 1 represents the whole. They partition, place, count, and compare fractions. They also notice equivalent fractions are placed at the exact same point and recognize that whole numbers can be written as fractions.</p>\n\n<h4>Grade 4</h4>\n<p>In Grade 4, students extend their learning in Grade 3 with unit fractions to explore fraction equivalence and extend this understanding to mixed numbers. A variety of models are used to aid in comparing fractions and mixed numbers as well as representing them. Benchmark fractions, such as 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4, are crucial as students work to generalize and make sense of the size of relative fractions and mixed numbers.</p>\n\n<p>In the problem shown below asks a student to: <em>Use a number line, multiplication, and division to decompose and compose fractions. </em>Students first partition a number line into thirds and then decompose 1 third into 4 equal parts. Next, they write a number sentence using multiplication to show a fraction equivalent to 1 third on the number line (4/12)</p>\n\n<p>Students also write the equivalence as a number sentence using division. Students verbalize that four copies of 1 twelfth is equal to 1 third and it’s possible to compose smaller units to make a larger unit.</p>\n<p>In Grade 4, students also use the number line to compare fractions.</p>\n\n<h4>Grade 5</h4>\n<p>In Grade 5 students build upon their work in Grade 4 to add fractions to and subtract fractions from whole numbers and mixed numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Another way students use the number line is to assist in rounding decimals. In the example below, students decompose to round 9.975 to the nearest one, ten, tenth and hundredth.</p>\n\n<p>In the final module in Grade 5, students relate the number line to the coordinate plane and graph coordinates in quadrant 1.</p>\n\n<h4>Grade 6</h4>\n<p>In Grade 6, students extend their knowledge of the number line and the work done in <em>A Story of Units</em> to include the left side of zero: the negative numbers. Through strengthening their understanding of negative numbers, students build upon their work in Grade 5 in the first quadrant and further relate the number line to the coordinate plane to graph in all four quadrants</p>\n\n\n<p>The number line model is one that appears frequently throughout the Eureka curriculum and this blog certainly does not illustrate every application of this model from Grade PK to Grade 6. Although the progression of the number line was only highlighted until Grade 6, the first year of <em>A Story of Ratios</em>, this model makes many appearances throughout the rest of <em>A Story of Ratios</em> and <em>A Story of Functions</em>. I challenge you to find examples of how this model is used throughout Grades 7 to 12</p>\n<p><em>This post is authored by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dawn-Pensack-Eureka-Math-Grades-5-6/1628157847414042?fref=ts' title='' rel=''>Dawn Pensack</a>, a </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a><em> writer for </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eureka-Math-Grade-6/921873154531571?ref=hl' title='' rel=''>A Story of Ratios</a> (Grades 6–8)</p>	2015-07-23 23:00:20.33026	2015-09-24 01:00:31.19149	<h4>Aha!

They often know about the more popular science based jobs like engineers, doctors, and veterinarians, and the paths to those careers are fairly straightforward. The reality is there are many many more possible STEM jobs, but when you are in high school it can be very hard to see that. I am going to share my story for two reasons</p>\n<>To show high school students one possible path to a job in tech.</>\n<>To show you don't have to have it all figured out in high school.</>\n<p>I am very glad that tech and computer science found me. I would love to help it find other smart young women before they go to university so they can be part of it too!</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*eEQuaDSfpWkOuFnCN47fvw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">High school graduation</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>Become a Math teacher</h4>\n<p>When I was in high school I was very good at math. I took the high school calculus class and prided myself on obtaining better grades than the boys. When it came time to choose a career I went to the school counselor for advice. He said,</p>\n<>You're great at math and science and you are a girl, so you should be a math teacher.</>\n<p></p>\n<p>My 17 year old self naively believed him and didn't even consider schools with engineering, mathematics, or computer science programs. I went to the University of Lethbridge in Alberta to become a math teacher.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*9z4dX2aoGY0oMJ83DL9kug.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">The University of Lethbridge in Alberta is one of the top schools to go to to study teaching in the prairies.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p></p>\n<h4>Change of Heart</h4>\n<p>After my first year there I realized that the most critical part in becoming a teacher was to be passionate about teaching. Teaching is such an important job and I really felt (and still do) that to be a truly great teacher you need to be dedicated to it. I found that I was passionate and dedicated to mathematics and not teaching. I decided not to become a teacher<em>. </em>That was the best choice I could have ever made</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*o15DcpkyJcvcyZV1gbwG6A.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Java was the language I learned in my very first computer science class. It was also the main language I used as a developer at BlackBerry.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>A discovery</h4>\n<p>I waited until my third year of university to take my first computer science course. All my friends told me it was very hard and no fun at all, so I had put it off. After the first few classes I realized it was no more difficult than my other math classes and I enjoyed it. That is when I fell in love with Computer Science. What I hadn't realized before was that the strongest skills you need for computer science are logical thinking and problem solving. These are exactly the skills that people who are talented in mathematics have. I loved that computer science gave me a real world way to use this talent.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*deNVNYKjkxMnuPTeY5S9QA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Cryptography: the science or study of the techniques of secret writing, especially code and cipher systems, methods, and the like.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>Cracking codes</h4>\n<p>Later in my third year of university I decided to join the co-op program to try and acquire some much needed job experience. It was a bit late, but I thought better late than never! In the summer I worked as a research assistant with a professor in the math department and wrote some code for him to help him with his research. While doing that a posting to work at <a href='https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en' title='' rel=''>Communications Security Establishment</a> (CSE) came up. They were looking for math students with computer science experience. Excellent! That was me</p>\n<p>The job involved cryptography.</p>\n<p><a href='http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cryptography' title='' rel=''><em>Cryptography</a> the science or study of the techniques of secret writing, especially code and cipher systems, methods, and the like</em></p>\n<p>This was the third biggest discovery of my career. I loved mathematics, computer science, and cryptography was the best way to combine both of those. I did three co-op terms at CSE and learned a lot about cryptography and being a software developer. I decided this was the career path I wanted to take.</p>\n<h4>A Decision</h4>\n<p>After my first two co-op terms I only had a year of courses left. Realizing my passion was cryptography and knowing most jobs in that field required a master’s degree, with encouragement from a fantastic female mathematics professor I decided to pursue a master’s degree.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*YngH4x1gbhT36ERujYDbUg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">This is me outside the math building at the University of Waterloo.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I was thrilled to be accepted by the university of Waterloo! Much of the cryptography work I had studied previous to my master’s was written by crypto greats like Dr. Alfred Menezes, Dr. Scott Vanstone, and Dr. Doug Stinson, and all three were professors at the University of Waterloo! While at the University of Waterloo I took courses from both Dr. Menezes and Dr. Stinson. It was like being taught by a celebrity. Both professors also became reviewers of my thesis on electronic voting algorithms. Later in my career I was fortunate to work with Dr. Vanstone and Dr Menezes in the private sector.</p>\n<p>A few months before I was to finish my degree I started looking for a job. It was late 2002 and the tech bubble had recently burst. The job market for software developers did not look promising.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*URdPBm2bOUKsTWseVCIO9A.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>Connections are Everything</h4>\n<p>In the summer of 2003, while still a grad student, I attended a cryptography conference. There I met a co-op student that was working on the “crypto team” at BlackBerry (then called Research In Motion). I also met four of the other developers that were working on the same team. We had dinner together at the conference and they were all on their BlackBerries during the meal. At the time I didn't even own a cellphone, so it was a new experience for me.</p>\n<p>After applying to various companies for jobs I ran across the co-op I met the previous summer. We made small talk and he asked me what I was up to. I mentioned I was looking for a job and wasn't having much success. He remembered I was finishing a degree in cryptography and suggested I email him my resume so he could pass it on to the boss of the “crypto team” at BlackBerry where he worked the summer before.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*lID1I1pw3QcexZO8G4hbkA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">My first BlackBerry was the 7230. It was also my first cellphone!</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>Dream Job</h4>\n<p>A couple of weeks later I landed a job interview at BlackBerry and in January of 2004 I started my dream job as a security software developer at BlackBerry. When I joined BlackBerry there were fewer than 1 million BlackBerry users and only just over 1000 employees. I was able to ride the ride that was BlackBerry, and what an incredible ride it was.</p>\n<p>I built the first wifi security protocols for the first wifi BlackBerry, was a key member of the team that developed the <a href='http://us.blackberry.com/ataglance/security/products/smartcardreader/RIM00731_smartcard_brochure.pdf' title='' rel=''>BlackBerry Smart Card Reader</a>, implemented <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_countermeasure' title='' rel=''>electromagnetic countermeasures</a> for <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES' title='' rel=''>AES</a> on the BlackBerry, maintained the BlackBerry Cryptographic API, filed many patents, acted as an internal security consultant for other teams, and lead the development of large features and projects</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*4ucBvMczARf7Z3Zg5sg9mA.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">I designed and wrote Java and C++ software for the SmartCard Reader, BlackBerry, and Windows Driver Components of this two-factor authentication solution.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>After 5 years I had a baby and spent a year at home with her. I love my daughter to bits, but I really was happy to go back to work when she was a year old.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*-bT7SNjxrqia0bu1lYjh5g.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">This is a shot of me at my desk at BlackBerry in the fall of 2011.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>Leading</h4>\n<p>When I returned to work I dove back into my job and within a couple of months I was given the opportunity to become a team lead. One of my coworkers said,</p>\n<>This is the least surprising promotion I have ever seen!</>\n<p>Why? Because I had been doing the job of a team lead well before and after my maternity leave. It was a natural transition for the team and myself. I loved the new role. I was excited to continue leading projects, designing security architecture and features, and being an internal security consultant. However, with the new role I was also able to flex the new skills involved with people leading. I found I loved it! This was the fourth major change in my career.</p>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*D3WxabFFdf8snLgIc5iExg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Myself and @chantastique at Ada Lovelace day 2013.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>Moving on</h4>\n<p>After eight years at BlackBerry I chose to move on. I left BlackBerry and went to Trustwave, a security company, as a development manager. It wasn't a good fit for me however, and in the fall of 2012 I accepted job as a development manager for a team at D2L (then Desire2Learn) in the fall of 2012. In the november of 2013 I gained another team and in February of 2015 I was promoted to Senior Development Manager.</p>\n<h4>Love what you do</h4>\n<p>I no longer work directly in the field of security, but I love the work I do. I focus on helping teams build high quality software as effectively as possible. I excel at building teams, fostering an environment for innovation, and helping them improve their skills and achieve their full potential. I enjoy working with teams and organizations to identify areas of improvement to help them be as effective as possible. I strive to collaborate with others to determine what we should solve, how to solve it, and how to test that satisfies the customer needs.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*GOnW-wV-Dt7imQyGslgCSw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4>Be Open to new ideas</h4>\n<p>It has been 15 years since I took that first computer science class and I haven't looked back. I love tech, I am often an early adopter of new technology. I become as excited as a kid on Christmas day when I obtain a new tech gadget, or better yet, to be part of building something new. I love my job. I love how it pushes me everyday to be my best, problem solve, build new technology, and collaborate with smart people.</p>\n<p>I am where I am today because I commit fully to my goals, I work hard to achieve them, and I am open to taking different paths when opportunities arise.</p>\n<p>You too will figure some of it out along the way.

Unfortunately George Bernard Shaw did not create this sentiment, but only helped to give it voice. But, Shaw’s infamous line does serve as a window into the perceptions of many into the profession of teaching. It makes me wonder, why aren’t teachers viewed as experts?</p>\n<p>As unpopular as I feel this may sound, I think we, as teachers, must recognize aspects of how we have traditionally gone about our work that has contributed to this sentiment. I see three main issues</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*TWcLps1AwPfeSHQdj7SWlg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<>Transparency</>\n<p>In a recent conversation I had with Sean McComb, 2014 National Teacher of the Year, he proposed an approach that would remove the mystery of what happens in the classroom: Invite policy and decision makers into our classrooms. By having legislators and policy writers experience first-hand the realities of the classroom, we, as a profession, can better influence the decisions that are made throughout our system. Have you invited your superintendent into your classroom? Your local congressman? A Board of Education member?</p>\n<p>Not ready to invite guests into your classroom? Well, there are other steps to make our work transparent: blogging. I know, I know, you are probably rolling your eyes at this point, but hear me out for a second. Writing and publicly sharing what happens in our classrooms demonstrates to the world that learning is at the heart of a classroom. It makes public the messiness of the classroom. It shows the world that we are indeed practitioners. It demonstrates that we are focused on growth. There is also another benefit, people might give you feedback and we might all grow together.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*HDDtr2OKeNTINd-MzGt1AQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>2. Abdication\nClosely linked to a lack of transparency is the fact that we have abdicated many of the decisions that are made about teaching and learning. While we rely on our elected officials to make decisions for constituents and Education is a national political issue, do we as teachers actively engage in a solutions-oriented manner for this end? To do so, it requires proactive instead of reactionary thinking.</p>\n<p>We must become practitioners of action-research in order to learn for ourselves what’s best for our students and classrooms. For too long, we have relied on “experts” to “train” a work force to help others learn. We must be the lead learners, in order to impact our craft and student outcomes, but most importantly to inform and influence the legislative and policy decisions that are being made for us.</p>\n<p>3. Best vs. Good Enough</p>\n<p>When it comes to the re-imagining that our schools need, we are mired in the models of the past. These experiences that confine our own schema are difficult to overcome, but in order to change the experience that school needs to be for today’s students, we must be willing to question everything. We settle for “re-purposed” tools and experiences that never really worked to begin with, but provide us with a certain level of comfort and security. I know the common idiom is “Don’t let perfect become the enemy of good”, but I believe in Education we practice “Don’t let Better happen, because we are good enough”. We must continue to strive for better. We must consistently be willing to analyze our programs and strategies and techniques in order to assess their effectiveness.</p>\n<p>I know all of these ideas probably aren’t popular. But I would like to engage in a conversation about what we, as teachers, can do to improve our profession. How do we transition from a job to a profession? How do we do a better job at working together for the behalf of all students? How should we engage with others to improve outcomes for all?</p>	2015-07-22 03:00:53.567278	2015-08-03 17:01:42.496829	<p>As a teacher the one idiom that irritates me to no end is “Those that can, do; those that can’t, teach”.

120	6	Emotional Inclusion in Public Schools	Fighting the “I am a rock; I am an island” notion in education	2015-08-04 17:24:16	dc9864f852a0	<h3>Emotional Inclusion in Public Schools</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fighting the “I Am a Rock; I am an Island” Notion in Education</p>\n<p>When teachers think of inclusion in school, their minds probably go to a certain type: special education. For the last fifteen to twenty years, this inclusion movement has introduced students with special needs into the mainstream classes, and that should be celebrated.</p>\n<p>But it’s crazy not to imagine that this is the only aspect that needs to be included into the average public school classroom. Take a moment to think: What else needs to be included? What else is lacking?</p>\n<p>These days — and admittedly, this may be due to the company I tend to keep in the educational world — one may say “technology”. This facet of school, however, is on the tip of everyone’s tongue as something to work on including. “Consistency” is another. “Rigor”, “PBL”, “standards-based grading”, and so on — all these terms are being thrown around as things to systematically include in one’s classroom.</p>\n<p>I think we’re missing one important one, though: emotion.</p>\n<p>Emotion is like your friend’s partner you’ve never met — they always sound so wonderful, but if they’re so great, how come we’ve never seen them? That’s how it is in the world of education. Teachers in training learn that <a href='http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/oct94/vol52/num02/How-Emotions-Affect-Learning.aspx' title='' rel=''>attaching emotion to learning</a> helps cement it in a student’s memory; they learn the usefulness of <a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Laughing-Classroom-Everyones-Teaching/dp/0915811995' title='' rel=''>making students laugh</a>, feel concerned, etc. But even now, the old adage of “don’t let them see you smile before Thanksgiving” is alive and well. Teachers are supposed to be like Simon and Garfunkel’s “<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKlSVNxLB-A' title='' rel=''>I Am A Rock</a>”, but instead of books and poetry to protect them, it’s curriculum and pedagogy. Teachers are unflappable, unassailable, unnaturally unemotional</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it can be argued that the very things that are on the cutting edge of best practices — rigor, technology, standards-based grading, etc. — are inherently anti-emotion and therefore serve to edify the “I Am A Rock” teacher. Perhaps this is the subconscious motivation of the proponents of these practices; perhaps they are uncomfortable with the messiness of emotion in the classroom and come up with educational tools that, while perhaps having validity in some facet of schooling, undermine the emotional potential of a classroom. Best practices can be warped to isolate the teacher emotionally from the class or classmates from each other, thus solidifying the teacher being the “rock” or “island”. It is a comforting thought for some.</p>\n<p>Emotion is messy. It is a breaking down of a fourth wall of sorts to see a teacher laugh, cry, fear, or express anything beyond happiness or disappointment in reaction to student’s activities. It introduces variables that lead to unpredictability in the classroom. No teacher knows just how a student, or class for that matter, is going to react to their showing of emotion.</p>\n<p>Messy though it may be, it is effective. Seeing a teacher that is truly moved invites a student to empathize with the teacher, and through this empathy a community is fostered. And through this community, maximal learning is fostered. Emotional inclusion also helps develop proper emotional development in students, especially the ones that come from emotionally bereft families or families whose emotional footprints on a student are unhealthy. In modeling emotion, you are that much closer to teaching the whole child.</p>\n<p>I propose a movement to consciously include emotion in one’s classroom. There are many ways teachers can allow emotion to percolate in, but if you need a rudder to guide you, try this:</p>\n<p>Work towards a situation when you, as teacher, have to look a student in the eye and say “Thank you.” Not thanks for handing in homework or getting the stapler for you or the Dunkin’ Donuts gift card at the end of the year. Thanks for something bigger, that means something to you. The postulate is that the bigger the thing is for which you are thanking the student, the more you have included emotion in your classroom. The less like a “rock” or “island” you are, and the better your students (and you) are for it.</p>	2015-08-04 19:00:47.047054	2015-08-04 19:00:47.047054	<h3>Emotional Inclusion in Public Schools</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fighting the “I Am a Rock; I am an Island” Notion in Education</p>\n<p>When teachers think of inclusion in school, their minds probably go…</p>

Search Youtube for different topics? Search the net to learn about something you are doing? Tried a MOOC (Massive Online Open Class)? Participated in a Google Hangout? Done a Mystery Skype?

How about a new summer bbq recipe or some new salad dressing?</p>\n<p><strong>That’s What We Do</strong></p>\n<p>These are just a few things that I and many of the educators that I know would consider to be just what we do. Learning new things, trying new experiences and seeking out ideas that push our own thinking about the world and our own place in it. Yet, is that what the majority of the population is doing? Are people reaching out to new experiences, trying new things and learning? According to Philip Pape in <a href='https://flipboard.com/@kwhobbes/books-m1a49fsjy/this-habit-will-put-you-in-the-top-1%25-of-experts-and-money-makers/a-a547nkfXS0mLoTW2TWEn0A%3Aa%3A1929522-ecd39e75f3%2Fpickthebrain.com' title='' rel=''>This Habit Will Put You in the Top %1 of Experts and Money-Makers </a></p>\n<><em>25% of people have not read a book in the last year46% of adults score in the lowest two levels of literacyReading frequency declines after age eight</em></>\n<p>Yet, when you’re surrounded by people who read, support reading, encourage reading and like reading, it can seem that most people read and are into learning new things. But is that what is happening? It’s hard to tell. In doing some digging, it appears that <a href='http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1290797114127/1290797724067' title='' rel=''>Canadians</a> are reading</p>\n<><em>A 2005 readership study by the Department of Canadian Heritage (PCH), READING AND BUYING BOOKS FOR PLEASURE, found that nearly 9 in 10 (87%) Canadians said they read at least one book for pleasure in the 12 months preceding the study1 and that half (54%) read virtually every day. The average time spent reading is 4½ hours per week (unchanged since 1991); the average number of books read per year, 17 (down only slightly from 1991). Fully one-quarter (26%) reported that reading is the leisure activity they most commonly engage in, as many as cited TV-watching, putting reading and TV-watching in the #1 spot among leisure pursuits in Canada (and dwarfing “Internet activities,” which only 9% cited). These findings support thePCH report’s conclusion that “reading for pleasure remains a solidly established and widespread habit with little or no change over the last 15 years.”</em></>\n<p>Now, reading isn’t the only way people learn. In fact, through access to information on the internet, learning in some areas of the world is easier via video and audio. I used this video to repair a crack in the windshield.</p>\n<p><a href='https://youtu.be/YK1kpSZpMPM' title='' rel='nofollow'>https://youtu.be/YK1kpSZpMPM</a></p>\n<p>Learning is available all around us. But as <a href='http://www.stevehargadon.com/2015/08/if-you-are-planning-for-year-sow-rice.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter' title='' rel=''>Steve Haragon</a> discusses in his latest post there is a dissonance that he is seeing and sensing in the world around which is impacting people</p>\n<><em>In the absence of coherent and engaging ways of viewing and improving our world, and of helping each other, the result may be that we shut down. We surrender our sense of agency. Cognitively and emotionally, our normal awareness and empathy bubbles shrink down to small, individual, spaces.</em></>\n<p>It may seem like this at times, especially when there is so many things that are happening and change is taking place at a rapid pace, so quickly that, for some, retreating is a way of coping. I know that there are times when the constant cacophony of educational voices imploring the need for change can feel overwhelming. In some cases, it would seem that throwing out the baby with the bath water is not only desirable but the only way for progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Teachers are Bombarded</strong></p>\n<p>This summer has seen an increase in the number of learning opportunities for teachers and it looks like this will continue well into the school year. For many teachers, summer is a time to recharge and refresh themselves. Learning is definitely a great way to replenish one’s batteries but in the past few years there has been a growing number of activities and conferences which now includes online conferences, edcamps and MOOCs plus weekly twitter chats and book clubs. These opportunities vary, each one vying to get the attention of teachers.</p>\n<p><strong>What does a teacher do?</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the rhetoric that fills some blogs, most teachers are life-long learners, trying to improve their classroom practice. With so many ideas and options available, trying to cope can seem daunting. The image of teacher-as-superhuman doesn’t seem to be far off!</p>\n<p>Go to this conference!</p>\n<p>Get this certification!</p>\n<p>Get more certification!</p>\n<p>Start a blog, write a book, present at a conference!</p>\n<p>Embrace makerspace, genius hour, inquiry learning, flipped classroom, flipped staff meetings, flipped professional development, gamification of the classroom and school and professional development — make all things fun and engaging.</p>\n<p>At a time when teachers and education seems to be lacking, improvement seems necessary.</p>\n<p>Teachers who are learners and work to improve their teaching are being overwhelmed.</p>\n<><em>“Teachers retreat into themselves, not because they don’t care but because they care so much and so deeply they are being overwhelmed.”</em></>\n<p>I can’t remember the source for this quote. As an administrator, I would use this as a way to remind myself that part of the role of being an educational leader was to help teachers to manage the constant bombardment. If teachers with whom I was working were becoming overwhelmed by all the demands, it would show in there day-to-day interactions. That meant being with them in their classrooms and working with them on projects. Hiding in the office under the desk only to appear when there were good things happening isn’t a successful leadership style. Were the initiatives and requirements draining the care right out of the teachers? If it seemed that teachers were withdrawing, it was time to realign so that people didn’t disengage.</p>\n<p><strong>Are we killing the love of learning in teachers?</strong></p>\n<p>Are we becoming over zealous and driving people away? Are we using the excuses of like technology integration and student performance to push our own narrative of good teaching?</p>\n<><em>“I have seen the light and now you need to or your are a bad teacher!”</em></>\n<p>In fact, it’s creating a gap. People who just a few years ago weren’t engaged or were just beginning to engage with technology and using social media seem to have made themselves gatekeepers and gurus who proclaim what is and what is not good for teaching and what constitutes good teaching. Teachers are bombarded with someone’s version of what it means to be a good teacher and a lot of it has to do with using some kind of technology or program or …. or… or….!</p>\n<p><a href='http://www.toddhenry.com/' title='' rel=''>Todd Henry</a>, author of<a href='http://www.amazon.ca/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=the+accidental+creative&tag=googcana-20&index=aps&hvadid=12394610506&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14644850710418051302&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_6fslp6dhxr_b' title='' rel=''> The Accidental Creative</a> and <a href='http://www.amazon.ca/Die-Empty-Unleash-Your-Every/dp/1591845890/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1438670056&sr=8-1&keywords=die+empty' title='' rel=''>Die Empty</a> and creator of the podcast <a href='http://www.accidentalcreative.com/category/podcasts/' title='' rel=''>The Accidental Creative</a> discusses in his interview with <a href='http://www.accidentalcreative.com/podcasts/ac/podcast-ron-friedman-on-the-best-places-to-work/' title='' rel=''>Ron Friedman</a>, a tendency to only post the positive-self online, the trips, conferences, publishing, accolades and not the more human parts that get people to these destinations so that it seems everyone we view is living these immaculate lives and doing all the great stuff which can lead to some serious anxiety as people think they need to keep up.

This in turns allows people to work together in new ways that until now were unattainable due to costs and distance</p>\n<><em>we’re seeing the spontaneous rise of collaborative production: goods, services and organisations are appearing that no longer respond to the dictates of the market and the managerial hierarchy.</em></>\n<p>As highlighted by Godin in <a href='http://www.amazon.ca/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591844096/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1438670543&sr=8-1&keywords=Linchpin' title='' rel=''>Linchpin</a>, relationships and giving to others are changing how people and companies interact. We may only be at the beginning of this shift, but for schools and teachers, building relationships with students, other teachers and their community is so important. Teachers and schools no longer control the knowledge and content that students can access. Although many teachers and schools continue to try, some educators are making the shift to helping students to become inquirers, supporting the student as they learn, focusing more on the learning and relationships and less on controlling content and assessment</p>\n<p><strong>Highly Organized and Controlled</strong></p>\n<p>As schools, school systems and, to some degree, teachers struggle with trying to control information and content, there is a rise in various methods being used to control what students do, when they do it and how they do it. Highly structured uses of technology and implementation of various systems used to monitor and provide feedback to students continue to dominate classrooms as teachers continue to be required to provide traditional grades and students are required to take traditional tests. Despite these requirements, there are teachers who are pushing for greater openness — Genius Hour, Makerspaces, Gamification, Inquiry Learning, and versions of Blended Learning and Flipped Classrooms all are stretching the traditional classroom to become more learner focused with greater autonomy on the part of the learner.</p>\n<p><a href='http://digitalnativesct.blogspot.ca/2008/06/moving-on.html' title='' rel=''>Stephen Wilmarth</a>, in his chapter <a href='http://suny-shanghai-wiki.wikispaces.com/file/view/Chap+5+currr+21.pdf' title='' rel=''>Five Socio-Technology Trends That Change Everything in Learning and Teaching</a> from the book <a href='http://www.curriculum21.com/' title='' rel=''>Curriculum 21</a> Edited by Heidi Hayes Jacobs, explores how technology can lead to greater social interaction and learning. As Wilmarth explain</p>\n<><em>Be assured, I am not advocating that children do not need to learn to read. They do. Or that writing will not be necessary. It is. Or that the process of arriving at sums no longer matters. It does. But all of these things are the outcomes of social adaptation to prior technological change and invention. It is the nature and relevance of reading, writing, and sums that change as we enter the postliterate era. Significantly, it is and relevance of reading, writing, and sums that change as we enter the postliterate era. Significantly, it is the way in which we make meaning out of information to create new knowledge that is changing.</em></>\n<p>The relationships that are created within classrooms are beginning relationships of learning. Through social networks, we now have the ability to expand these learning networks beyond the classroom.</p>\n<><em>Joining communities of interest and shared values (personal, family, cultural, political, economic) has always been essential to a learner’s identity. In this case, identity equates to where an individual is on the learning curve. And where traditional community relationships once defined a learner’s identity, emerging social networking technologies allow wholly new community associations to spring up organically and globally. These community ties, both strong and weak, exert a powerful influence on learning.</em></>\n<><em>First, keep in mind that social networking technologies are changing rapidly. Second, remember that the technologies are not the point. In social networking, it’s important to concentrate on relationships, not technologies.</em></>\n<p>Teachers are coping with changes on multiple levels both as learners and, in turn, as teachers. To think that teachers will all be able to move at the same pace is akin to saying all students in the classroom will learn along a linear timeline, at the same pace, with the same tools, doing the same things and arrive at the same time. I don’t know anyone who still believes this takes place in a modern classroom.</p>\n<p><strong>Do You Love Learning?</strong></p>\n<p>As classrooms and schools move through transformational phases, there will continue to be different degrees of adoption and change. Unlike many who seem to be frustrated by a seeming lack of change, I am optimistic because I have seen so much change in so many areas in the past 4 or 5 years. Twitter, which was once a fairly lonely place for me, is now a fully vibrant learning network with connections of all types of learners and leaders. Interestingly, some of the earlier adopters who were avid sharers are now less involved in the networks, working more in a different avenues such as presenting and blogging or become teacherpreneurs on their own.</p>\n<p>What drives all these people? I believe it is a love of learning that is at the heart of what they do which leads them to share and connect with others to share that passion, building relationships with others through learning. I believe their passion for learning fuels their passion for teaching. For others, that spark needs to be kindled and fanned not crushed and blown out by a constant bombardment.</p>\n<p><strong>I Wonder……</strong></p>\n<p>…. what if teachers were supported as learners, trying to move through a myriad of changes along with everyone else? What if their learning was supported and valued, incorporated in the their work and part of a systemic view of learning as work?</p>\n<p>….. how educational leaders can support teachers as they transition to a learning system where discovery and asking questions is of primary importance instead of content and knowledge distribution?</p>\n<p>…. what if learning and relationships were the primary areas of focus? How might schools change to meet the needs of students and teachers through these two lenses?</p>\n<p>…. where wondering and innovation will fit as educational institutions transition from being content and knowledge distribution centres?</p>	2015-08-04 19:00:47.477027	2015-08-04 19:00:47.477027	<p><strong>Do you love to learn?</strong></p>\n<p>Try new things?</p>\n<p>Explore new ideas?</p>\n<p>Read books/ebooks about a variety of topics?

After meeting for lunch at a quaint little sandwich shop on Bay Street, we headed back to his office so he could give me a tour. Now, I had watched “The Internship” which is set at the Googleplex in California so I had a bit of an idea of what to expect from the environment. But seeing new age corporate offices on a TV screen and experiencing them firsthand are two completely different things. Experiencing it made me think about our ideas on classrooms of the future.</p>\n<p>As we strolled through the offices, he showed me their games room, equipped with a pool table, arcade-style basketball hoops, ping-pong and the likes. We passed by “resting hubs” for employees who wanted to take a break (at any time in the day). I noticed what I would term “graffiti walls” and “graffiti columns” were people could scribe anything from words of wisdom to short notes. There were stick-up pads each titled something to the tune of, “I am thankful that…” at the top. In the middle of the day, during the middle of the workweek, it blew my mind to see a group of workers laughing as they played an impromptu game of improv in a lounge area. Employees whizzed around to get to places on scooters. Everyone was smiling, everyone seemed happy and most importantly, all were productive.</p>\n<p>As I left, I couldn’t help but think about how this idea of the cutting edge corporate workplace breeds productivity. These companies, who are some of the most successful and innovative in history, are that way because of the environment they foster. These spaces are not your traditional workspaces that seek to eek out productivity by pushing their workers to the limits through placing them in tiny grey cubicles surrounded by manila painted walls. The environment of these places begets innovation. It is education’s turn to learn a thing or two from these new wave corporate workspaces.</p>\n<p>Imagine a space where students weren’t shuffled off from room to room by the signaling of a bell. A place where students still had to be at school by a specific time and leave school at a specific time, but in between could spend their time in an environment where mental wellness was a priority. Of course, just like the employees at Google or Facebook, “quotas” would still remain precedent. Those employees all have deadlines and mandates to meet. But they are not micromanaged the way that most traditional businesses and <em>all</em> schools currently operate</p>\n<p>We want our schools to breed curious and innovative students but our environment shouts of the opposite. We sit children in rows on rows and instruct according to the minutes in the week, day or period, yet we hope that this type of instruction will breed innovation. Part of creating innovative and creative students is teaching content that will allow for it. But I think another part of fostering this capacity is in the very environment in which we force these students to learn. This is an area that often gets overlooked in discussions pertaining to education reform. If we want our students to think “outside the box”, we have to acknowledge the box that education currently sits in.</p>	2015-07-25 01:01:04.409984	2015-08-03 17:01:32.712406	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*uF735hSr3XgXBWtDqFe_Pw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Yesterday I went to visit a friend from college who works at a “social media” office here in Toronto (I am using the term social media because they made me sign a…</p>

141	7	A Declaration of Independence: How Exploring Probability Using Two-Way Tables Clarifies the…	Aha! Moment	2015-09-02 16:07:44	74a561b22f43	<h4>Aha! Moment</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>I must confess: I like teaching probability. I enjoy discussing concepts like fairness and expected value with students, as well as analyzing games of chance. However, even as a fan of probability, I have fallen into a few traps that seem to be pervasive in high school mathematics classrooms. One of the foremost mistakes I have made in the past is to erroneously apply the multiplication rule to find the 0probability of multiple events. In other words, <em>P(A </em>and <em>B) = P(A) x P(B) </em>is only valid when events is only valid when events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are independent, but I have applied this rule to events without attending to the condition required to use it</p>\n<p>For some events, independence is evident. Students tend to recognize that for fair number cubes and dice, the outcome of a single toss or roll does not help us to predict the outcome of future events. Similarly, the lack of independence is sometimes evident, such as multiple draws of cards from decks without replacement. However, as students are required to compute the probability of multiple real-world events, independence or the lack thereof is often not as easy to discern, and, for various reasons, teachers may find themselves telling students to “assume independence” to facilitate neat probability calculations. By doing this, though, we may give our students the erroneous impression that the multiplication rule can be applied in all situations that do not fit the “multiple-selections without replacement” mold. To be honest, it can be difficult to assess the independence of real-world events using classic textbook probability problems, but the <em>Eureka Math</em> Algebra II curriculum provides excellent opportunities for the students to analyze and assess independence using two-way tables</p>\n\n<h4>What it Looks Like</h4>\n<p>In Module 2 of Algebra I, the students learn how to construct and interpret two-way tables. In Lesson 4 of Module 4, students work on an example introduced in an earlier lesson containing data on participation in an after-school sports program, where the data is displayed by gender. The students are challenged to determine whether being female and participating in an after-school sports program are independent events, using the data in the table below.</p>\n<p>The students compute row-conditional probabilities from the table to compare the probability that students participate in an after-school sports program given a) the student is randomly selected from those who were surveyed, b) the randomly-selected student is a female, and c) the randomly-selected student is male.</p>\n<p>For instance, the probability that a randomly selected student participates in an after-school sports program is:</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the probability that a randomly selected student who is female participates in an after-school sports program is:</p>\n\n<p>And the probability that a randomly selected male participates in an after-school sports program is:</p>\n\n<p>Given that the value calculated for the probability of a randomly-selected student participating in an after-school sports program is the same whether the gender of the student is known or not, we can say that knowing the gender of a randomly selected student does not help us predict whether he or she will participate in an after-school sports program. In other words, the events are independent. In this case, it would be appropriate to apply the multiplication rule for calculating the probability of multiple events. For instance, the probability that a randomly selected student is female <strong>AND</strong> participates in an after-school sports program is</p>\n\n<p>This value corresponds to the data from the table: 232 out of 1,000 students are females who participate in an after-school sports program.</p>\n<h4>Why This Matters</h4>\n<p>First, working through problems such as those presented in Algebra II Module 4 provide students with a deeper understanding of independence than the often stated “independence means that the outcome of the first event does not affect the outcome of the second event.” These examples demonstrate for students how they can verify independence using real-world data, which is important in situations that reach beyond spinners, coins, cards, and dice.</p>\n<p>Second, understanding the conditions for independence may help students avoid the trap of applying the multiplication rule where it is not appropriate. The Eureka lessons provide the students with important tools to help them critically analyze probabilities reported in research, which may also tend to assume independence.</p>\n<p>Third, examples such as those presented in <em>Eureka Math</em> enable the students to derive the multiplication rule based on their understanding of conditional probability. Namely, if by the definition of conditional probability</p>\n\n<p>However, events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are independent, so knowing the outcome of event <em>B</em> does not help us to predict the outcome of event <em>A</em>. Therefore, <em>P</em>(<em>A </em>| <em>B</em>) = <em>P</em>(<em>A</em>). By substituting</p>\n\n<p>and applying the Multiplication of Equality gives <em>P</em>(<em>A</em>) x <em>P</em>(<em>B</em>) = <em>P</em>(<em>A </em>and <em>B</em>)</p>\n<p>Discovering this relationship for themselves increases the likelihood that students will understand the multiplication rule and apply it appropriately.</p>\n<p><em>This post is authored by Sara Lack, a </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial?ref=tn_tnmn' title='' rel='nofollow'>Eureka Math</a> <em>writer for </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eureka-Math-Grades-9-12/788314054589598?ref=tn_tnmn' title='' rel='nofollow'>A Story of Functions</a><em>.</em></p>	2015-09-02 17:00:17.701091	2015-09-24 01:00:20.453634	<h4>Aha!

She taught a 4th/5th grade split class this past year, but has taught most of the elementary grades. She shared her thoughts about </em>Eureka Math<em>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>How did you start using <em>Eureka Math</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>I was the first person in West Virginia to use it! We had adopted the Common Core and I was asked to train other elementary teachers in the county. We were using the series <em>Everyday Math</em>, but it clearly wasn’t aligned to the Common Core and many teachers were struggling to find resources. I was looking in a lot of places for good curricula and found <em>Eureka Math</em>. At first, I used it [Eureka] without telling anyone in case it was not useful. I loved it. I saw how it changed how I taught and how my kids were learning. So I shared with teachers in my school. At first teachers had to buy it ourselves, but now our school and maybe two others [of 13 elementary schools in the county] have bought it for the whole school</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the difference?</strong></p>\n<p>The main thing is their students’ confidence with math. They can tell you what they’re doing and use the right vocabulary. They feel like math thinkers and they are. They feel a little superior. They want to explain it. They’re going home and showing their older brothers and sisters and parents and grandparents how to do math. And they have an attitude that they want to learn more.</p>\n<p><strong>Why aren’t more schools using it?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m sure there is at least one teacher in every school [in Mercer County] using it, probably about a third of elementary teachers overall in Mercer. But a lot of teachers are a little leery of using what the county hasn’t trained them to use. The county endorses the use of <em>Eureka Math</em> now, but we still use <em>Everyday Math </em>as a curriculum. <em>Eureka Math</em> is not something you can do a little of. It needs to start at the beginning and it works better if all teachers in your school are using it. Once I get teachers to use it, they love it</p>\n<p><strong>What turned the tide?</strong></p>\n<p>Their STAR [interim test] scores. We had huge jumps on the STAR Renaissance test this year in math, not in English. I’m sure it was because of <em>Eureka Math</em>. They could see how much progress their kids were making.

Student debt would be one reason.	2015-07-26 01:34:53	694773c926dc	<>Photo Credit: <a href='http://startupstockphotos.com/' title='' rel=''>Startup Stock Photos</a></>\n<p>Joining a startup team is an amazing, wild, incredibly worthwhile experience. You get to work on a growing project and see real, tangible products of your work on an innovative, risk-taking team, and you are forced to grow your skills daily in order to succeed. It’s an experience I would encourage almost any young person to take if the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n<p>It can also be relatively costly.</p>\n<p>If you’re lucky and get in early enough, you’ll probably get equity, but the equity isn’t really worth much unless there’s an exit. You’ll get a salary, but it will probably be much lower than taking a job at Megafaceless Corp, LLC. in Manhattan, or some government bureaucracy in DC. And there’s a good chance that you will be living in a place like the Bay Area, Austin, or Boston, all of which have crazy expensive costs of living.</p>\n<p>That isn’t to say that it doesn’t pay off in satisfaction, long-term options, or even financial rewards, depending on the way you take that experience.It’s simply to say that taking a job at a startup as a young person when there are other options in more traditional roles at more traditional companies is something that can be <em>relatively </em>costly. Lots of entrepreneurial young people would kill for the opportunity to be part of a growing, innovative team doing work that is the direct consequence of their day-to-day actions. When you work at a large organization, it’s a lot harder to see the consequences of your hard work</p>\n<p>In <em>Office Space</em>, Peter Gibbons, the apathetic protagonist caught in an ennui-inspiring job for the drab Initech corporation notes this exact sentiment</p>\n<><em>Peter Gibbons: The thing is, Bob, it’s not that I’m lazy, it’s that I just don’t care.\nBob Porter: Don’t… don’t care?\nPeter Gibbons: It’s a problem of motivation, all right? Now if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don’t see another dime, so where’s the motivation?</em></>\n<p>To see the real consequences of shipping a few more units, to stay up at night to make sure you can compile all your code because you want to launch a new site on the next day, to travel across the country to make a sale that can bring thousands in for the company, and to see all this happening because you are working hard is something that brings motivation itself.</p>\n<p>So why <em>wouldn’t</em> you take a job that allows you that kind of motivation, flow, and productivity</p>\n<p>Student debt would be one reason.</p>\n<p>Young people are presented statistics and testimonials while growing up, getting ready to apply to college, and going through college about how a college degree is worth X payoff and taking out loans makes sense to get that degree to achieve X payoff.</p>\n<p>Making that extra chunk of money associated with a degree (which is a dubious statement based on broad generalizations about opportunity costs, but that can be ignored for now) may be a great motivation to take out loans if all you are concerned about is making more money, but if you are concerned about more than just making money and instead care about the <a href='https://medium.com/synapse/it-s-not-about-working-for-free-it-s-about-being-free-15b8e03a179e' title='' rel=''>opportunity and freedom</a> to pursue your goals like working on a startup or launching your own venture (something that is itself very costly), then you should think twice before signing off on those student loans</p>\n<p>If you have $45,000 in student loans for a generic degree from a liberal arts college, you might get past the HR lady at a nonprofit or a corporation you are kind of interested in that will pay you $40,000 or $50,000 your first year. If you can’t afford to pursue a startup that will pay you less but will help you come alive as a person, then your student loans haven’t <em>meaningfully</em> opened up options for you. For what you are trying to achieve from your professional life and your education, taking on student debt has actually made your life more difficult and stymied your ability to meet those goals</p>\n<p>To imagine it another way, taking out a loan (n) to buy a large pickup truck may open up plenty of options for moving things around, helping people with their stuff, or launching a lawn care, carpentry, or plumbing business. You could crunch numbers about how all these things can provide a payoff that is n+1, making it financially worthwhile for people to take out loans to get pickup trucks. But this example is patently absurd because we recognize that not everybody is going to need a pickup truck to achieve their goals. Even more, purchasing that pickup truck and being forced to pay off the loan for it shuts out options that would have otherwise been available, like driving long distances economically. If your goal was to go on a road trip, start your own delivery service, or even become an Uber driver in your spare time, the advice that you needed to take out a loan for a pickup truck actually <em>undermines </em>your goals</p>\n<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal </em><a href='http://www.wsj.com/articles/want-to-be-an-entrepreneur-beware-of-student-debt-1432318500' title='' rel=''>recently ran a piece</a> recently noting some empirical observations that back up this claim that student debt makes it harder to launch or get involved in new business ventures</p>\n<><em>In the study, published last year, researchers looked at student debt across the U.S. by ZIP Code and compared it with small-business formation in those areas. Between 2000 and 2010, a one-standard-deviation increase in student debt in a ZIP Code led to an average 25% reduction in the number of very small businesses, those with one to five employees.</em></>\n<p>Even if you aren’t looking to start this business, getting involved in a venture with a low starting salary is something that you can only do if you have the freedom from debt to do so. Isaac Morehouse <a href='http://blog.discoverpraxis.com/debt-can-limit-your-options/' title='' rel=''>puts it well</a></p>\n<><em>the lower your wage requirements, the more flexibility you have early on to explore and test and find work you love. Keep that in mind with each step. Ask whether your present decisions are limiting your future options in a way you might regret.</em></>\n<p>So next time somebody harangues you about how you just need to take out more loans to finish your degree, ask yourself if doing so is going to open the <em>right doors for you</em>.

Swiss firms in the US will expand apprenticeship programs, using local community colleges to hold the instruction segments and their own firms for the work segments. This. Is. Happening. <a href='http://bern.usembassy.gov/ev-07092015.html' title='' rel=''>Coming to a city near you!</a></p>\n<p>Here’s the problem with the Texas plan and others like it in the US.</p>\n<><strong><em>We are shoving all students through a narrow funnel, into a homogenous learning model that is higher education in the US.</strong></em></>\n<p>Whether a student chooses community college or an elite 4-year college, we call it college. The student is forced to choose a <em>version</em> of college, but college is still the only option</p>\n<p>So what about the kids who cannot stand the thought of sitting in a classroom, getting through more core requirements after they complete compulsory schooling? Well, these kids can tell their families, with head hanging and eyes down to the floor, that they are going to forgo college education (the scenario is even more bleak for children of immigrants, whose parents may have come to the US in large part so their children could obtain higher education). Then, they either work in Bob’s auto shop until they feel like experts and maybe open their own shop, or hope to become the next Mark Zuckerberg…</p>\n<p>There really is no designated path for the kid who knows he wants to start working, who knows exactly where his passions lie and who doesn’t want any distractions.</p>\n<p>There is no job training that combines classroom time with work time to give a student a degree in a specialized field and a career that he can be proud of. <strong>No, we don’t have that in the US, but this is an integral part of Swiss society.</strong></p>\n<p>When the US comes gawking at their smooth-running machine that is dual education, the Swiss couldn’t imagine it any other way. Only about 30% of students choose the university path. The rest choose one of many options for professional training, be it in sales, carpentry, hairdressing or manufacturing. Students who choose this latter path can go on to graduate from “Fachhochschule”, university for the trades, and earn the same respect (if not more) as their peers in university.</p>\n<p>This also means that universities are not all things to all people in Switzerland — they don’t have to be. There’s no reason that turf management or even business, should be housed at a university. <strong>These are career-centric subjects for career-minded students. Students who want to pursue these fields should have a path open to them, not just a college path, that allows them to receive highly specialized, quality training in their fields.</strong></p>\n<p>I would bet that if students in Texas had a similar dual model in which students desiring to enter a trade could study and learn on the job without the same course requirements and expectations as at a college or university, then Texas would exceed its 60% goal. And even better, its young people (from both the university path and the trade path) would feel greater career pride, knowing they are truly experts in their fields, doing work that is really quite special.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Ellison is the Founder and Chief Dunce at <a href='http://duncecp.com/' title='' rel=''>Dunce Labs</a>, where she helps students launch their futures — to college and beyond.</em></p>	2015-07-26 03:00:53.084024	2015-08-03 15:01:20.91919	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*BFw8IY9JA7Jza5XwP2CEGQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Texas wants <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/2015/03/21/more-eighth-graders-get-degree-increase-small/' title='' rel=''>60% of young people</a> to have some sort of degree within 6 years of graduating high</p>
117	6	Rockaway Avenue	Acknowledging privilege while confronting nuanced inequalities.	2015-08-03 19:17:17	5c6d27cb52d0	<h3>Acknowledging privilege while confronting nuanced inequalities.</h3>\n<p>When people use the word privilege, I’m definitely not the first thing people visualize. I moved to the United States when I was three, and my parents worked tirelessly to ensure that my siblings and I would have the education and opportunities unavailable to them in the Philippines. Personally, when I think of privilege, my mind immediately conjures an image of the quintessential white girl who says stuff like “my life is harder than yours because I have to <em>feel guilty</em> about my parents paying the full cost of my tuition.” I’m not white, and consequently, I’m at a disadvantage to my white counterparts. That’s not up for debate. Yet, since I grew up in middle class suburbia, I had access to many more opportunities to succeed than most</p>\n<p>I still identified with some of the various struggles people of color face. When I was in school, all my classmates saw were the cultural divides between us. The reality of being a minority includes encountering microaggressions: being the punch line of jokes, or being undermined in the classroom or work place on a daily basis. There are additionally other, more concrete difficulties that are associated with being an immigrant, such as trying to provide for a family and save for the future with little to no savings, and even employment discrimination that comes along with having an “ethnic” last name. Sometimes all that bullshit just swirls in your head and hearing a coworker joke about subservient stereotypes of Asian women seems almost as awful as institutionalized discrimination. <strong>So as an Asian American from a working class family, I thought I understood, to some degree, the plight of being black in America.</strong></p>\n<h3>In a predictable turn of events where the students in a classroom teach the instructor, I was wrong.</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>I volunteered for an organization called <a href='http://www.generationcitizen.org/' title='' rel=''>Generation Citizen</a> last semester, because I had always found myself in teaching positions and am passionate about politics & policy. It was one of those opportunities that brought out the best in me. I wanted to help those who are all too often ignored by traditional modes of political empowerment, partly because I too, had felt powerless and marginalized by existing institutions of power. Just maybe not to the same extent</p>\n<p>The school where I worked was in Ocean Hill, on the cusps of Brownsville, Brooklyn. The building was a short walk from the the Rockaway Avenue subway stop, and each time I emerged from the station I felt immersed in a much different New York than the Village I’d begun to call home. Nestled in a predominately black neighborhood, the school building itself housed four different public and charter schools. On my first day, I was completely lost and disoriented when I tried to find the classroom on my own — despite being in the right building and on the right floor. My fellow co-Democracy Coach and I often felt a little out of place, despite both of our minority backgrounds. Brownsville is actually <a href='http://nymag.com/news/features/brownsville-2014-6/' title='' rel=''>notorious for it’s youth gang violence</a>, and my co-DC and I were responsible for a class of 8th grade boys in the same demographic. Initially, I was intimidated by the middle schoolers; they were proud and rambunctious and determined to present a tough front</p>\n<p>As a student instructor coming from outside their neighborhood, I couldn’t help but feel like the boys saw us as rich kids who wanted to feel good about themselves a couple times a week. Throughout the semester, we discussed local civics and created plans for advocacy. Our class was focused on mitigating gang violence in the local parks, while the class across the hall wanted to advocate against police brutality. Eventually, we felt comfortable with one another to divulge details about our lives. Some of the boys wanted to know what college was like, and others were just thankful that they were assigned two female Democracy Coaches. Halfway through the semester, our concerns with youth gang violence intensified after a territorial brawl broke out after school and one of my students was caught in the fray. Still, even as we drew up plans to address the issues occurring a block away from the school, it still felt foreign and distant to me. After all, each afternoon I’d get back on the train and go back to Manhattan. I might not have been a “rich” college student looking to exploit my students for points on a resume, but I definitely wasn’t one and the same with my students either. It never sunk in that I was constantly walking away from their underserved community and back to my privileged one.</p>\n<p>The day after the NYPD aggressively halted protests in Union Square, I thought it was necessary to discuss Freddie Gray’s tragic death with my class. I remembered when I was in 7th grade and my band teacher let us watch President Obama’s inauguration on his TV. It was technically a digression from our studies, but immensely important.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*srW-_yK39AJ5lMAQpWNEMg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Protesters Gather in Union Square in response to Freddie Gray’s death: April 30, 2015</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I showed them the pictures I had taken for the school newspaper, and recounted stories of classmates being arrested and blaring announcements through the night. Some of the students were impressed that I had taken the photos myself, others glanced out the window. Finally, I made a passing remark about helicopters monitoring the lingering crowd’s movements.</p>\n<h4>“<em>Damn</em>, she must live in a nice neighborhood,” one kid glanced at his peer, “They would never check up on here.</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>I paused. I was in front of the classroom, trying to foster solidarity, but for what? The fact that whirring helicopter blades woke up my roommates? I had been concerned after my classmates had been peacefully arrested and held for a few hours, yet each day these kids had to be concerned about bumping into the wrong people, or rubbing a cop the wrong way. They worried about ending up beaten or dead. I was the one instructing them how to advocate for themselves in an unjust world, all while not fully comprehending the significance of their injustice. The consequences of the racial inequality that impacted my students were radically different than anything I had experienced.</p>\n<p>What does one say when a student calls out their privilege? Do I pretend like I have the same visceral understand of their life experience? Do I qualify the opportunities that my parents and and home community gave me? Do I justify where I live and go to school with the impending student debt that will haunt me for the rest of my adult life?</p>\n<p>Or do I acknowledge my privilege and accept the fact that life has thrown some wicked adversities my way, and I <em>still</em> had a much better chance than others. Despite my own underprivileged status as an woman, immigrant and racial minority, I cannot ignore the blessings automatically granted by my socioeconomic status and familial support. Nor should I become defensive and offended when I’m reminded of those blessings</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to accept privilege I didn’t ask for. To check my privilege feels like I’m copping up to cheating on a test or taking something that isn’t rightfully mine — despite jumping through the hoops of putting in hard work over the years. I felt pangs of guilt when I observed my students desperately trying to make the most out of an education I had taken for granted most of my adolescent life. Feeling guilty and feeling like I deserved to live the life I have was a troubling emotional dichotomy. Yes, I worked hard and ultimately turned things around for the better, but it pains me to wonder what good my students and their contemporaries could have done, if only they had the same resources I had growing up.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I cannot change what circumstances that I or my students must face. I cannot begin to fully rationalize or pretend to comprehend what those less privileged than I are<em> <a href='http://blacklivesmatter.com/about/' title='' rel=''>trying to call to national attention</a></em>. However, what I can and must do is be completely honest with my students and myself when staring in the face of inequality. Literally and figuratively, it’s not all black and white. Sometimes, people fall in between; they aren’t able to claim all the loveliness of privilege, yet they cannot claim to be completely marginalized. Discourse shouldn’t be a contest to see who has the moral high ground or who has it the worst. Rather, we should attempt to see our differences in a light of integrity. Even when that means checking a privilege we hadn’t previously known we had</p>	2015-08-03 17:01:17.47215	2015-08-06 09:00:38.774352	<h2>Rockaway Avenue</h2>\n<h3>Acknowledging privilege while confronting nuanced inequalities.</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>When people use the word privilege, I’m definitely not the first thing people…</p>

Along the way, just as anyone would when starting something new, I learned a lot</p>\n<p><em>Blogging to me is an art form, it cannot be prescribed. There is no right or wrong formula when it comes to blogging, and that is the first step that a beginner blogger should realize to maintain its aesthetic feel of authenticity, subjectivity, and stream of consciousness.</em></p>\n<p>However, there are a few things that I would like to share with new blogger that I think would be beneficial.</p>\n<p><strong>Write like no one is reading:</strong> This was probably the hardest part of blogging for me. I always tried to imagine who my audience was and tailor my thoughts to them. But I learned that when it comes to blogging, to maintain its authenticity it needs to be reflective. Your inner thoughts about strategy, practices, pedagogy, and anything professional that you’re sharing should be shared as authentically as possible to allow yourself room for growth after the process of reflection. This may include sharing not only past successes but also failures. And that’s okay, because it is upon us sharing our failures that we reflect, learn and grow</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t find your niche, find your passion:</strong> Many would recommend that you focus your writing on a specific subject, and while that may be helpful when it comes to thinking and planning before the writing process, it can often “pigeon-hole” you into that area. Instead of trying to focus your area of expertise, find your passion. What are you most interested at the moment? What is something that’s taking up a lot of space in your thoughts? Is there a subject/topic that you just learned about and would like to share your experience with others? Writing about one’s passion maintains that level of authenticity that engages your readers to your story</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t forget to tell your story: </strong>When I look at my past most read blogs, I notice two common elements: authenticity and storytelling. I keep going back to authenticity, because it weaves into the thread of blogging as an art form that needs to take an authentic shape in writing. Most of my writing that resonates with my readers come from the heart. The ones that do not share my story, feelings, or experience have less engagement. Storytelling, although becoming a cliche of its own, is a powerful tool to incorporate into your writing. The reason for that is your readers want to hear your experience, your voice, and they’re looking for that personal piece of connection. Blogging allows for that connection and mental interaction with your readers, but it can only happen by incorporating a piece of yourself in your writing</p>\n<p>I am sharing these important areas with other writers because for me to figure these out it was a process of trial and error, but also a process of writing, writing and more writing. It can be discouraging for new writers to see that their work is not yet resonating with an audience. However, maintaining the mindset that blogging is a reflective tool that *you* need to do for *yourself* can take some of the new-writer pressure off and allows you to find your authentic voice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>This post was originally published on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blogging-tips-101-beginners-guide-rusul-alrubail?trk=prof-post' title='' rel=''>LinkedIn</a>.</em></p>	2015-07-27 19:01:04.722802	2015-07-27 19:01:04.722802	<h3>Blogging Tips 101: A beginner’s guide</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>I started blogging almost a year and a half <a href='https://medium.com/@RusulAlrubail/my-professional-development-5e64959b9684' title='' rel='nofollow'>ago</a>, and have documented my blogging journey on many different publications, but most <a href='https://medium.com/synapse/it-s-almost-a-year-since-i-began-my-blogging-journey-after-becoming-a-connected-educator-i-looked-41109dacede6' title='' rel='nofollow'>recently</a> on my own</p>

I taught history and then computer science to middle schoolers, as well as technology integration to fellow teachers. With administrators and other teachers, we introduced new learning standards and objectives, built new curriculum, and learned on the fly how to translate old ways of doing things to the 21st century.</p>\n<p>In and out of the classroom, much of what we tried failed. Each time, we reassessed and tried again.</p>\n<p>In the classroom, my colleagues and I tried to deliver well-planned lessons to students. We asked thought-provoking questions and fielded challenging objections from students. We did all this with a view to convincing the kids that we had the content and skills that will benefit them.</p>\n<p>Outside of class we considered the best practices of colleagues who had been in education for decades, emulating much of it and adapting the rest to a new, student-empowered style of educating. I was also fortunate to collaborate directly with leadership to chart the course of this change. We didn’t know anything more than anyone else; we just got the ball rolling and tried to maintain its pace.</p>\n<p>Since I left schools, I’ve worked at three startups. Things haven’t really changed.</p>\n<p>Like before, new strategies often fail. Once again, we keep what worked and then revise what didn’t. Failure isn’t virtuous, but it’s useful, so long as it leads to learning.</p>\n<p>Instead of lesson plans, my colleagues and I deliver well-planned pitches to potential customers. We ask leading questions, fostering dialogue. We handle considered objections from clients. All of this is done with a view toward our product being most beneficial to the client. Our job is to work with clients to arrive at the best solution for them; the “sage on the stage” model works no better in business than it does in the classroom. In fact, good teaching and good sales look a lot alike.</p>\n<p>Also similar: everyone is learning on the fly. There are no experts (be skeptical of those who say they are.) At each of these companies, everyone is trying to learn what digital tools and experiences people want and need, and how to build a company that can ship these products now and forever. Silver bullets don’t exist in teaching or business.</p>\n<p>So, like we did in faculty meetings and PD, we share what’s worked for us. We learn from colleagues’ backgrounds who have been in business for decades, and try to discern what new lessons this week has taught us.</p>\n<p>Schools that are evolving to meet 21st century demands are approaching their pivots in much the same way as startups handle business every day. I was very lucky to get the training I did in schools: I learned good sales by learning to teach; I learned how to manage and support change by collaborating with colleagues across an organization; and I learned to never stop learning.</p>\n<p>I do miss teaching.

Hugh gave this speech during a recent California Assembly hearing about teachers’ rights. Unfortunately Abi, an LGBT teacher is leaving her job at SHC because of concerns about Archbishop Cordileone’s proposed changes to teachers’ contracts and to her work as a teacher and LGBT ally.</h4>\n<h4>Hugh and Abi have consented to sharing this information.</h4>\n<h4>Best wishes, Abi! ‪#‎<a href='http://www.teachacceptance.org/' title='' rel=''>teachacceptance‬</a></h4>\n<>Hugh’s speech</>\n<p>Hi everyone, my name is Hugh Mac Neill, and I’m gay. Next year I’m going to be a senior at Sacred Heart Cathedral High School. This past year has been a rollercoaster, with Archbishop Cordileone attempting to take away teachers’ rights by labelling them as “ministers,” and also condemning me and my community as “gravely evil.” I wrote this speech both to tell you the importance of teachers who are LGBT allies, but also as a goodbye letter to a teacher who has been one of my biggest role models.</p>\n<p>Dear Ms. Basch,\nI’m not exactly sure how to tell you this, or where to start. But I suppose I have to start somewhere. I was sitting on a Caltrain to Palo Alto. I had recently received my schedule for next year, and was ecstatic to find that you were going to be my government teacher. While I hadn’t gotten the chance to have you as a teacher yet, I felt as if you had been menntoring me for months. You had proofread my Teach Acceptance speeches, helped me draw posters for rallies, and talked to me about college. You were a person I could trust, and I could say, with confidence, that you were on my side.</p>\n<p>I know that you had been under pressure from the Archdiocese because of your public support of LGBT students. I understand the risks you were taking, but I never realized how much your leaving would affect me until I found out you weren’t coming back next year. And when I was trying to put together something to say, I kept thinking, “This doesn’t feel like I’m saying goodbye to a teacher, it feels like I’m saying goodbye to a friend. An ally. Someone who would stand up for me.” As you can see, I’m still having a little trouble letting this go because that relationship meant — and means — so much to me. Whatever I’ve said, or attempted to say, these last few days seemed to be imcomplete.</p>\n<p>So I think I’m finally ready to say goodbye. I hope that you spread all the joy, empowerment, and hope at your new school that you have shared with my school. You have given our school and our community so much. You have given ME so much. Without you, I wouldn’t be standing here right now giving this speech. I hope that this becomes a symbol of why students NEED teachers who will support them — no matter their sexuality, their family structure, or their conception.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_FMPrFk6Ltb5JAkRXL1mLg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<>And a message from teacher Abi Basch</>\n<p>Yes it’s true — I am leaving SHC and moving to Los Angeles to teach at the Buckley School. Also true — I am doing it in large part because I do not want to work without state and federal workplace discrimination protections that most Californians enjoy. And another truth — I AM LGBT. Now that I do not work for Archbishop Cordileone, I can say to my students, their families, my colleagues — without fear of losing my job: I am not only your ally. I understand your magic queer powers and the dangers you face when others fear their might — because I have them too.</p>\n<p>Hugh Mac Neill — you wrote me such a beautiful open letter for the #teachacceptance Phil Ting hearing yesterday — thank you for letting me post it here. (Everyone read it! You will cry, I promise.)</p>\n<p>I am so proud of you for being who you are and standing up for justice. I am moved by all of my students and colleagues, the parents (!!!) and gay and civil rights activists that have rallied around the #teachacceptance cause. I have learned boundless amounts from you.

The Network Effect, sometimes called “Metcalfe’s Law”, is less well-known, but equally relevant if we want to understand how the unique economics of the Internet are influencing higher education</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*KgnZdy9G5mDNZx86OKtxjQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">Shutterstock.com</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Economies of scale is concerned with the impact on the cost per unit that results from increases in the number of units created and sold. Network Effects, on the other hand, concerns the impact of volume on the value to the end-user of the good or service. When the Network Effect is present and positive, the value of the good or service increases as more people use it. Social media is a commonly cited example: as participation in P2P networks like Twitter and Facebook rise, the possibilities for new interactions, and the range of available content increases — which, in turn, increases the value of using the network for each participant.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the Network Effect seems to have little relevance to higher education. Value in higher education is conventionally thought to correspond to low volume: smaller classes and more exclusive institutions, for instance. But the continued migration to Internet-based learning and services in higher education has the potential to change the relationship between volume and value. Critics of MOOCs, for example, argue that students won’t learn or persist with an educator-to-student ratio of 50,000 to one. But advocates point out that by using peer-to-peer learning in this context, the value of the MOOC could actually grow as the number of participants increases.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the application of social media to higher education often fails to leverage the Network Effect, highlighting the importance of context on the value of technologies. Social media thrives when there are thousands, if not millions, of users within a single, overarching community. The high volume of users provides online communities with enough activity and content to ensure that each user finds what and who they want with sufficient frequency to make participation worthwhile. Twitter and Linked In now have over 300 million active users. But higher education typically restricts participation to a single class (e.g. 40–100 students per course).</p>\n<h3>When More is Better</h3>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the concept of Network Effects is most often associated with products and services that involve networks in which people or objects are connected in some fashion, such as telephone systems and, as mentioned, social media. But many writers have expanded the concept to include other types of product or services in which the value for each user increases as the number of users climbs — regardless of whether the people or objects are connected in a network. For example, the value of knowing how to use a software program like Microsoft Excel will rise for each job-seeker as it becomes the industry standard.</p>\n<p>A similar dynamic between volume and value can be seen in the sphere of <a href='http://acrobatiq.com/' title='' rel='nofollow'>learning analytics</a>. We can use analytics to understand and address the needs of each student. But additional, equally-valuable insights be generated by aggregating data across a larger number of learners. By reviewing student performance data across a number of institutions we can identify patterns based, for example, on socio-economic status or high school GPA. This kind of information is an important aid to institutional strategy (e.g. recruiting tactics, financial support, student services), and better government policy and funding</p>\n<p>::</p>\n<p>The first and second instalments of this series on Internet Economics can be found here:</p>\n<p><a href='http://acrobatiq.com/internet-economics-and-online-higher-education-series-introduction/' title='' rel=''>Internet Economics and Online Higher Education (Series Introduction)</a></p>\n<p><a href='http://acrobatiq.com/internet-economics-scale-and-online-higher-education/' title='' rel=''>Internet Economics: Scale and Online Higher Education</a></p>\n<p>::</p>\n<p><em>Keith Hampson, PhD is part of the team at <a href='http://acrobatiq.com' title='' rel=''>Acrobatiq</a>.</em></p>	2015-07-28 03:00:41.862465	2015-08-03 07:01:10.924673	<p></p>\n<p>Most people are familiar with economies of scale, which we discussed in <a href='http://acrobatiq.com/internet-economics-scale-and-online-higher-education/' title='' rel=''>a recent post</a>.

127	7	Gaining a Profound Understanding of the Value Pi	Strategies	2015-08-20 19:49:35	5320fec69437	<h4>Strategies</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the fourteenth day of the third month of each year, teachers and students all over the country celebrate what has become known as <em>Pi Day. </em>The significance of this day is its numerical date of 3.14, a common approximation of what some consider to be the most famous ratio value of all, pi. Many celebrate this day by decorating their surroundings with the Greek symbol for pi, <strong>π </strong>, making creative culinary creations such as pi pie, or challenging their students to memorize as many digits of the value pi as possible. This much celebrated day helps people remember what is arguably the most common approximation of pi but what it fails to do is provide an understanding of what the value of pi is and where it comes from. I recently posted a question on social media requesting that people answer the question: <em>What is pi? </em>The results were nearly as I expected. Responses consisted of 3.14, 3.1415, 22/7, and a misspelled tasty dessert. A few of my teacher friends and colleagues, however, figured out what I was up to</p>\n<p>I am certainly not trying to take the fun out of this <em>most revered</em> day of the year for many math classrooms, but I am trying to show that the fun must not be limited to only one day a year. In <em>Eureka Math</em> Grade 7, Module 3, Lesson 16, students discover a profound understanding of this popular and useful ratio in a very short time using basic everyday materials and a little added guidance</p>\n\n<p>Consider a circular object such as a bicycle wheel or the top of a large coffee can. The distance around the circle, the circumference, can be found by <em>unrolling </em>the circle along a straight line on a flat plane. Once you have the circumference marked as a linear distance, use the circular item to determine how many diameters, the greatest width of the circle, can fit along the length of the circumference. What you will find is that no matter what size of circle is used, its circumference is <em>a little more than 3 times the length</em> of <em>the diameter</em>. Is this relationship just a coincidence? Let’s take it a step further. If you work to approximate how much more than three times the diameter, you can find that the circumference of the circle is a little more than 3.1 diameters of the same circle</p>\n\n\n<p>At a glance, this might seem like a meaningless observation, but it reveals that the circumference is a constant multiple of the diameter; in other words there is a multiplicative relationship between the diameter and the circumference of any circle. That is to say that the circumference of any circle is always a little more than 3.1 times the circle’s diameter (See illustration below).</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out, the exact value of the constant of proportionality that relates a circle’s diameter and its circumference in unknown because it is an irrational number. This means that the value is a decimal value that contains an infinite number of digits that have no repeating pattern. There have been many approximations of the value completed using geometric methods in the past, some reaching out to millions of digits in the decimal expansion. Because of the infinite trail of digits, using its exact numerical value in mathematical calculations is impossible. However, knowing how constants and variables behave when used in algebraic expressions and equations allows us to work with the value by assigning a symbol to represent that value without impacting precision in calculation. The symbol that was chosen to represent that value is the symbol for the Greek letter pi, <strong>π</strong></p>\n<p>Knowing where the value of pi comes from opens a door to even greater reasoning regarding the calculation of the area of a circle, which can then be extended into other curved figures and three dimensional geometry. Watch for my next blog post, <em>Why is it important to understand where the value pi comes from?</em>, that will extend the reasoning to the value of pi discussed here to its use in understanding how the circumference and area formulas for circles are derived</p>\n<p>So as the next <em>Pi-Day </em>approaches, consider providing your students with an opportunity to understand the true meaning of that famous value, the value of the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, that very important ratio value that mathematicians refer to as pi</p>\n<p><em>This blog post is authored <a href='https://www.facebook.com/1Beau.Bailey' title='' rel=''>Beau Bailey</a> a </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel=''>Eureka Math</a> <em>teacher-writer for </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eureka-Math-Grades-6-8/1617769018477628' title='' rel=''>A Story of Ratios</a> (6–8) <em>and </em><a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eureka-Math-Grades-9-12/788314054589598' title='' rel=''>A Story of Functions</a> (9–12)<em>.</em></p>	2015-08-20 21:00:16.342734	2015-09-23 21:00:21.656849	<h4>Strategies</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the fourteenth day of the third month of each year, teachers and students all over the country celebrate what has become known as <em>Pi Day. </em>The significance of this day is its numerical date of 3.14, a common approximation of what some consider to be the most famous ratio value of all, pi.

Google is rolling out <a href='https://www.android.com/auto/' title='' rel=''>Android Auto</a>, Apple has <a href='http://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-features' title='' rel=''>CarPlay</a>, Microsoft has <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/windows-embedded-automotive-7.aspx' title='' rel=''>Windows Embedded Automotive</a>, and Tesla has perhaps the <a href='https://vimeo.com/61821553' title='' rel=''>loveliest display</a> of them all. However, the dynamics of traveling with family haven’t changed</p>\n<p>These are 5 things I’ve learned from road trips that I think can apply to UX.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3><strong>1. Needs vs wants</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Set user priorities.\n</em></p>\n<p>What is more important; starting the next episode of <a href='http://www.nickjr.com/dora-the-explorer/videos/super-babies-dream-adventure-s5-ep513-full-episode/' title='' rel=''>Dora the Explorer</a> or taking the correct exit on the interstate? In a car there are needs and there are wants that masquerade as needs</p>\n\n<p>The car should respond in a way that takes in account the need for safety and navigation before personal wants, then rank those wants in order of overall importance, beginning with the driver and ending with the passengers.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes user wants become needs that jump to the top of the hierarchy.</p>\n\n<p>Another way of thinking of it is like this:</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>2. Safe at any speed</h3>\n<p><em>Keep eyes on the road.</em>\n</p>\n<p>A few terrifying statistics from <a href='http://about.att.com/story/smartphone_use_while_driving_grows_beyond_texting.html' title='' rel=''><em>ATT’s Smartphone Survey</a></em></p>\n<p><em>62% of drivers keep their smartphones within easy reach while driving.\n7 in 10 people engage in smartphone activities while driving.\n30% of people who post to Twitter while driving do it “all the time.”\n22% who access social networks while driving cite addiction as a reason.</em></p>\n<p>If a digital dashboard is more complicated to use than a phone then people will default to their phone, and that includes the drivers. Automakers are tacitly acknowledging this by working with Silicon Valley’s top mobile operating systems. Apple’s CarPlay and Android Auto use the driver’s phone to drive the car’s UX, forcing the user to look at the dashboard rather than down at their phones. But drivers are still not looking at the road. This needs to change.</p>\n<h4>Options</h4>\n\n<p><em>Disable certain heavy cognitive functions while in motion.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p><em>Only trigger actions by voice or steering wheel inputs.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p><em>Use cameras to determine if a driver is looking at content and instruct a driver assistant program to become more aware of the car’s surroundings and give the driver feedback if there is danger.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p><em>Use HUDs (heads-up displays) in addition to dashboard screens</em></p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p><em>Self-driving cars.</em></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>3. Are we there yet?</h3>\n<p><em>Create recognizable, clear, consistent, simple to use navigation.</em> </p>\n<p>The primary purpose of a car is to get us from one place to another. The primary function of a car’s UI should support this by being recognizable, clear, consistent and simple to use.</p>\n<p>Often times this manifests as a map or turn-by turn directions — which works great unless you’re moving too quickly to catch a sign, or it’s really dark out, or you’re traveling the backroads. In these cases a satellite view or a photo of each major turn would be very helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the UI is, it should not disappear when someone plays music, makes a call, or adjusts the temperature. Those moments always seem to come right when you need to take an exit.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>4. Fighting over the radio</h3>\n<p><em>Avoid bottlenecking UI elements.</em> </p>\n<p>Joe and Caroline are driving in a car. Joe turns on the radio and tunes to “<a href='https://soundcloud.com/prairiehomecompanion' title='' rel=''>Garrison Keillor’s Prairie Home Companion</a>.” Caroline immediately wrenches the dial away from tales of bachelor farmers to a pop station playing <a href='https://soundcloud.com/octobersveryown/drake-back-to-back-freestyle' title='' rel=''>Drake</a>. Joe immediately changes the station. This goes back-and-forth until</p>\n<p>1. They agree on a station.\n2. The driver declares that they get to choose the station because they’re driving.\n3. They turn off the radio and sit out their trip in hostile silence.</p>\n\n<p>Does this sound familiar? It’s essentially a fight over a UI bottleneck which is frustrating because we are used to controlling our entertainment environments with a variety of devices. A car should be the same way. Any approved user and device should be able to cast music or other content to the car’s entertainment system and the driver (and safety system) get veto rights.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h3>5. Reinvent the car space</h3>\n<p><em>The car is a shared environment.</em>\n</p>\n<p>A car is like a very small room that you can’t easily escape from, at least it can feel like that sometimes. The easiest thing to do is pull out a device, pop in earbuds and retreat into your personal space. There should be better alternatives to this than playing “I spy with my little eye…” for hours on end. But I haven’t experienced any.</p>\n<p>There is a great opportunity for someone to re-imagine how we spend time together. I’m hoping for a new generation of games, but at this point a great karaoke app would help.</p>\n\n<p>This space is only going to get more interesting as automated cars rollout and the form of automobiles morphs away from a driver-centric design. Group dynamics can change completely when people face each other. I’m looking forward to more social time.</p>\n<h4>Happy trails!</h4>\n\n<p><a href='http://www.mattsundstrom.com' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Matt Sundstrom</a> is in love with the future, drawing and user experience.

106	6	What Sandra Bland means to education	Unless you have been living under a rock, you have heard about, watched the video, or shared your opinion regarding the latest watershed…	2015-07-29 17:16:19	df882af261e6	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*zojOBAcnmbKWVjDvB-obuw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">photo cred: www.people.com</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Unless you have been living under a rock, you have heard about, watched the video, or shared your opinion regarding the latest watershed incident regarding yet another black body and the police state that is now engulfing the United States. This time it was Sandra Bland. Some (privileged bodies) still adamantly feel that we should leave issues like this outside of the classroom. My argument: What is the purpose of education if we are not going to talk about issues that affect our communities?</p>\n<p>After watching the video, I <a href='https://twitter.com/callmemrmorris' title='' rel=''>tweeted</a> that we have officially crossed over from “protect and serve” to “comply or die” and I was not surprised at the amount of activity such an accusation would stir up. That is because all people seem to be invested in the current state of affairs that America finds itself in. I recently told a friend that 15 years ago, if we had the technology we now have, we would already have had “this conversation” and one would hope to think that we would have “progressed” as a society. (I use the word progressed with quotations because I am fully aware of the potential of supremacies’ insidious tendencies to cloak and move on.) But the technological revolution is happening now — and we are visually exposed to black life on a scale that we only could share stories about before. The tangible effects of such atrocities leave education in somewhat of a quandary, with people taking up sides. Some feel that students are “too impressionable” to be exposed to the realities of the world while others hold the notion that we need to be critical and reflexive in our practice if we do truly want to uphold the ideal that education is a powerful weapon</p>\n<p>Instead of taking up arms (which is seemingly more of a possibility with every additional instance), we need to strategically use the weapon of education to arm our future so instances like Sandra Bland cease to occur. There is only one way to do this. We must have candid conversations within the confines of educational spaces so that we can hear from minds that are not so institutionalized to the point where they argue that Sandra Bland <em>was at fault </em>for her demise</p>\n<p>Along some Cornel Westish train of logic, many are pointing the finger by saying blacks are to blame for their predicament, I grow more tired each day battling people with these mentalities. What makes it worse is that many of these people are <em>black people </em>who think other black people are being too sensitive by painting every last instance that happens to blacks with a racist brush. My only question is: Are we to <em>blame </em>Sandra Bland for her death? The divide and conquer logic I have heard regarding this instance securely affirms the apolitical, status quo mentality that gets society nowhere. We must not forget that being apolitical in itself is a political stance</p>\n<p>By ignoring these issues in our classrooms, we are prescribing to a status quo logic that dates back decades. A mantra that upholds the ideal of, “let us educate <em>them, </em>but let us not educate them too much”. Citing Audre Lorde, “we can never dismantle the master’s house with the master’s tools”, but education and teaching that is grounded in exposing the flaws of society breeds a tool that the master never created. We need to step outside our politically correct and rigid ideologies of what education is intended for and start taking agency by providing youth with tools they need to dismantle a system largely based on injustices. And we need to start this early in schooling. University is too late. Education is meant to create critical individuals. Right now, it seems like education is simply creating lambs for the lions</p>	2015-07-29 19:01:02.731273	2015-08-04 11:00:51.954688	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*zojOBAcnmbKWVjDvB-obuw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>Unless you have been living under a rock, you have heard about, watched the video, or shared your opinion regarding the latest watershed incident…</p>
118	6	Why I Got Rid of My Teacher’s Desk	I had been thinking about it for about a year now. But the decision to get rid of my teacher’s desk was officially made on the final PA day…	2015-08-03 18:34:15	4b47b814b34	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-N4Sk9QKmlrVXAXarZ5ZFQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption">photo cred: www.matthewrmorris.com</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I had been thinking about it for about a year now. But the decision to get rid of my teacher’s desk was officially made on the final PA day of the school year when we came into school to clean up our classrooms. As I looked at this old, broken down symbol of authority, I asked myself a question, “<em>What if I didn’t have a teacher’s desk next year?” </em>The possibilities of what may become of that answer intrigued me more than the practicality of keeping it. So I scrapped my teacher’s desk. I asked a fellow colleague to help me move it in the hallway and when I told him that I was getting rid of it he seemed slightly amused by the thought, only to stare blankly at my face when we got it out the door and he came to the realization that I was actually serious</p>\n<p>But why do I need my own teacher’s desk? The desk is one of schooling’s traditional markers of power. It is the sign and sight of the authoritative figure in the classroom. The ruler of the classroom kingdom owns that space and it should not be messed with. I’ve seen teachers lose their minds on students when students sit at the “teacher’s desk”. We shuffle kids in and out of spaces and try different groupings throughout the year, but when one student ventures into the forbidden territory of sitting at the teacher’s desk, many teachers freak out.</p>\n<p>I used to be a teacher that cherished my invaluable teacher’s desk. I wouldn’t let kids sit there either. But then I realized that the teacher’s desk is just another obstacle that is impeding teacher-student relationships and classroom authenticity. When I was indifferent to students sitting and doing their work at my desk, I tangibly felt the power that such an object had on children. Students would vie to sit there during a lesson and then quietly do their work after. It became a site of privilege for students. This is because it is a site of privilege for teachers. The teacher’s desk allows teachers to sit and command from a distance. It fosters this idea of provisional self-esteem by signaling to the class that things may look like we’re promoting democracy but really things are running more like a dictatorship. I want the students who enter my classroom to realize that I truly am just the “lead learner” and next year I am going to start by helping them understand this through spatial transforming. And the first thing I had to do was get rid of my teacher’s desk.</p>\n<p>Getting rid of my teacher’s desk does not mean that I am better than any other teacher. What it means to me is that I am checking (or acknowledging) my privilege as a teacher in the space of the classroom and in order to facilitate a more equitable classroom community for my students, erasing one of the pillars of that inequity is a step in the right direction. I am comfortable in my role as the head member in my classroom, and I don’t need a teacher’s desk anymore to signify that.</p>	2015-08-03 19:00:51.302738	2015-08-06 15:00:55.609363	        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-N4Sk9QKmlrVXAXarZ5ZFQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I had been thinking about it for about a year now.

One can find, literally, anything at the touch of a finger. We have found, however, that a few thoughtfully compiled, well-formatted books have been indispensable in our home library. Intelligently presented information, often supported by interesting illustration, can go a long way towards engaging young readers in any material. And books can be dragged anywhere.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3><em>1. The All-New Book of Lists for Kids</em></h3>\n<h4>by Sandra and Harry Choron</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*e2YEEmG1C7WzH-wAUIXWug.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This book is fun and informative in surprising ways (and not so ‘all-new’, 13 years later). With seeming nonsense like, <em>“Important Dates in Pinball History”</em> and <em>“15 Foods That Further Flatulence”</em>, it’s hard not to get a kid’s attention. Once hooked, they find lists of great websites, books and films, and suggestions such as, <em>“5 Things You Can Do About World Hunger”</em> and <em>“How to Change the World”</em>. Stuffed with tidbits that you never knew but are strangely interesting — <em>“Stevie Wonder’s Childhood Hobbies”</em>, <em>“14 Questions You Would Be Asked if You Went to Clown College” </em>— and more that you are thrilled to discover — <em>“25 Black and White Movies You Should Watch”</em>, <em>“How to Say ‘I Have to Go to the Bathroom’ in 9 Languages”</em> — this collection has kept my family interested and has sent us on many merry tangential journeys</p>\n<h3>2. <em>In The Next Three Seconds…</em></h3>\n<h4>Compiled by Rowland Morgan, Illustrated by Rod and Kira Josey</h4>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*aC4GRi0QokjjH_EsAH6ZYQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This book of predictions based on statistical analysis is fun and thought provoking. Packed with illustrations, it forecasts events around the world — some mundane and some rather important — for the next 3 seconds, 3 minutes, 3 hours, 3 days, etc… With a brief, but interesting, intro and a bit of math about making your own predictions, this book encourages readers to look at the world in a whole new way — in terms of time. Perhaps the tiniest bit dated (1997), it nonetheless is quite entertaining and educational — the perfect mix.</p>\n<h3>3. <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em></h3>\n<h4>by Al Gore</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*yiDDE9K8J1vTXVD48hFQcw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This companion book to the former vice-president’s well-received documentary of the same name is a wonderful addition to the home library. Packed with eye-catching photos, graphs, and maps as well as many provocative statistics, it offers intriguing bits about climatology, geology, ecology, politics, and more. My kids have spent much time with this volume and I ended up finding it more valuable than the film. Don’t miss the film, however — it is entertaining and very interesting.</p>\n<h3>4. <em>A Street Through Time: A 12,000-Year Walk Through History</em></h3>\n<h4>by Dr. Anne Millard, Illustrated by Steve Noon</h4>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*dDFYe_bfrbkH7uD9dY7pnA.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This book is a delightful and intriguing journey through time on the local level. A street, somewhere in Europe, is followed from pre-history to present day in beautiful panoramic illustrations, jam-packed with detail. The scene is described and labeled and there is even a Waldo-like search in each. The youngest readers get lost in the pictures, while the older set (including myself) is amazed to see a site specific march through time. We can begin to imagine the history of our own street corners.</p>\n<h3>5. <em>The Random House Children’s Encyclopedia</em></h3>\n<h4>Edited by Ann Kramer and Miranda Kennedy</h4>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*VVgTuLbXLKsR1ftC1QYLtQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>An appealing introduction to research, this richly illustrated edition provides hours of interest. My son perused this book at a friend’s house and loved it so much that I went searching for my own copy. A world of information bursts from the pages in colorful, bite-sized pieces, making this a perfect beginner’s reference. The best kid’s encyclopedia I’ve found, by far. (This 1993 edition seems to be out of print, but is easily found used. Mine cost about $2 — a steal.)</p>\n<h3>6. <em>The Science Book</em></h3>\n<h4>Edited by Peter Tallack</h4>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*RETbdFo8_nlqzb-M1X3xNw.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>A collection of 250 snapshots of important moments in the history of science, this book is a great primer on a wide range of scientific thought. From 35,000 B.C. to the present, each discovery or idea is presented in 2 pages, one text and the other illustration, a format that grabs and holds the attention. This is a great reference for curious kids who soak up information like sponges. Leave it lying around the house and soon they will be teaching you.</p>\n<h3>7. <em>The Stars</em></h3>\n<h4>by H. A. Rey</h4>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*9c_73pa57RdxtzopjpOALg.png' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>A witty introduction to astronomy by the author who gave us <em>Curious George</em>, this book puts the sky in our hands. It equips us with maps, history, and drawings of constellations and key heavenly bodies. All ages can find pleasure in this inventive approach to the science of the skies. Rey also penned a simplified version for children, <em>Find the Constellations</em>, though I think that youngsters have much to gain from both volumes. This may be akin to blasphemy, but I find his star books much more valuable and entertaining than his monkey books</p>\n<h3>8. <em>Peterson Guides</em></h3>\n<h4>by Roger Tory Peterson</h4>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*9PsxhMKzbMxF4juQnKKImg.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>The quintessential guides to everything, these little books answer all manner of questions — what is this flower/tree/bird/bug/mushroom, etc…? They also provide pleasant browsing as they are beautifully illustrated and clearly formatted. The <em>Peterson First Guides</em> are a wonderful resource for young readers and the main series will be referenced by generations. With these guides at hand, you can answer many questions with, “Look it up.” A boon to harried homeschoolers. (Note: Many of these guides are penned by a host of wonderful authors, but as Peterson is the father of the series and has a hand in most, if not all, volumes, I listed only his name.</p>\n<h3>9. <em>National Geographic Atlas of the World</em></h3>\n<p></p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*5e7ncN3ElRHQc-xS_-f5Ag.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>This massive book may be my favorite of all reference and resource volumes. The scale alone allows for much detail and makes armchair traveling a pleasure. In addition to the comprehensive collection of physical and political maps, there is much fascinating, and appealingly presented, geographical and geological information. Add to this the satellite photos of our planet, and you have a giant book to fall into. All ages can find something enthralling in this volume. A little pricey, but worth every penny. (Note: My beloved copy is the 6th edition (1992) — there is now a 7th (1999), an 8th (2004), a 9th (2010), and a 10th (2014) — with updated political maps and marginally altered formatting.)</p>\n<h3>10. <em>The Body Atlas</em></h3>\n<h4>by Steve Parker, Illustrated by Giuliano Fornari</h4>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*uioHuJP5vAvFIs6aZHH6pQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<h4></h4>\n<p>This guide provides a fascinating introduction to the structure and mechanics of the human body. The illustrations literally peel back the layers of the body and are meticulously labeled. The text provides a wealth of information about every corner of this amazing machine we all call home and illuminates the details of its workings. This is a wonderful text for anyone wishing to know more about the body and will capture the attention of all ages.</p>\n<p>This group represents the very tip of a massive iceberg. There are so many terrific reference books out there, it almost breaks my heart to limit the list. But then, one could fill a whole volume with all the wonderful titles available.</p>\n<p>It bears noting that three of these ten books are from Dorling Kindersley, the international publishing house responsible for so many brilliant illustrated reference volumes. They have also given us Eyewitness books, another collection worth exploring. Due to the limited scope of this list, I have not mentioned any of the fine reference volumes about art, food, mythology, history — on and on and on it goes. Go to the library and take a dip in the vast ocean of reference. Everyone benefits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>A version of this originally appeared in Home Education Magazine.

143	8	These Two LA Bus Stops Might Change the Future of Cities	\N	2015-09-08 13:23:40	13268840f46e	<h2>These Two LA Bus Stops Might Change the Future of Cities</h2>\n<h4>Mayors are beginning to understand that citizens should have instant access to vital information — through the air. Here’s where it begins.</h4>\n\n<p>Digital-era humans are constantly optimizing — sometimes it feels as if we’re all engaged in an endless game of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger' title='' rel=''>Frogger</a>, continually navigating past a continual stream of obstacles, seeking the home of a thriving life. Nowhere is this practice as visible as in cities, where densely-packed populations weave past one another and new technology could provide opportunities to make life better. As mayors become more responsive to their citizens, how could adding the magic of public-enabled digital information to structures and streets help out? And what’s the role of the private sector in this transformation</p>\n<p>One possible answer is emerging in The Big Orange, Los Angeles. This summer, JCDecaux, the biggest company you’ve never thought about, <a href='http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2015/JCDecaux-and-Outfront-Media-launch-the-first-smart-bus-shelter-in-Los-Angeles' title='' rel=''>teamed up with Outfront Media and the city</a> to digitally-enable — hold your breath here — two bus shelters</p>\n<p>Don’t laugh. The implications of this humble pilot project are likely enormous, and it’s worth taking a look at the new levels of vibrant life to which this experiment points. It’s also important to note the changes in local governance that made the pilot possible in the first place.</p>\n<p>First, the leading player. <a href='http://www.jcdecauxna.com/' title='' rel=''>JCDecaux</a> is the world’s largest street furniture and transport advertising company, and has been around for decades. You may not know it exists, but its output is constantly in your face. Next time you go through an airport or a train station, look for the JCDecaux name — it will be there, because the company serves up ads on about 400,000 screens in more than 70 countries. JCDecaux can do projects of enormous scale and has deep and long relationships with cities around the world</p>\n<p>The company has traditionally focused on public transport advertising rather than orienting itself around cars and highways. In 2003, JCDecaux launched ad-supported self-service bike rental, beginning in Vienna. It now operates those systems in nearly seventy cities around the world. The Paris system, Vélib, has been particularly successful, with tens of thousands of bikes. (Here’s a nice bike-share <a href='http://www.citylab.com/city-makers-connections/bike-share/' title='' rel=''>interactive history</a>, courtesy of Atlantic’s CityLab.</p>\n<p>Now, the pilot for this LA story. This summer, <a href='http://designerestates.com/the-commute-downtown-la-just-got-a-super-fancy-new-bus-shelter/' title='' rel=''>JCDecaux and Outdoor Media outfitted</a> two bus shelters — the humblest, most old-fashioned of civic structures, both located near City Hall — with WiFi hotspots, a USB port for charging devices, and displays of transit information. They also have iBeacons, a kind of digital lighthouse that is constantly signaling its presence and sending small bits of data to nearby iOS devices (but only when those users have affirmatively opted to receive that data and have downloaded an app that makes the data useful). If you push a button, the bus shelters will talk to you, providing bus times. And they use less power because they’re equipped — retrofitted, really — with LED lights</p>\n<p>These structures may be called bus shelters, and people may indeed wait for buses in them, but they can also be understood as something much more: the first potentially responsive public structures in the enormous sprawl of Los Angeles. And the project can easily scale: Every one of <a href='http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/' title='' rel=''>LA’s 114 neighborhoods</a> has bus shelters. Think of what this could mean for the city as a whole. Every part of the city could have an interactive civic platform suitable for a host of uses, making real digital back-and-forth between the city and its places possible for the first time. Civic action; a neighborhood seeing itself; tourist happiness; local knowledge — all made visible</p>\n\n<p>On the connectivity front, I predict that people will get used to these things very quickly. We already live on several layers at once most of the time, both present in our physical location and present in our digital living room of email, alerts and ambient awareness of the digital flow of our lives. We’ll begin to assume that public WiFi will be present whenever we are in public places. And why shouldn’t we be able to charge our devices at any time, anywhere? Airports still need to get better at this. (JCDecaux has been providing charging stations in US airports for about five years, first in partnership with Samsung and now mostly with Verizon.) But maybe unassuming, omnipresent bus shelters will lead the way.</p>\n<p>Civic information and interaction could become, in the future, a bigger part of the role of public buildings. Right now, this pilot (and others across the country — an example is <a href='https://medium.com/backchannel/turning-phone-booths-into-hot-spots-will-take-new-york-from-worst-to-first-22433e2a742d' title='' rel=''>LinkNYC in Manhattan</a>) is ad-supported. But as cities gain strength in bargaining over later agreements, more of the real estate of public structures could be dedicated to public purposes: pushing out city information (not just bus times) and engaging with citizens about subjects that matter to neighborhoods. The privacy implications of the iBeacon are obviously important, and cities will want to be careful about who gets access to what personally identifiable information of citizens — for what purpose. (I’ve written about this <a href='https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/11/18/good-data-make-better-cities/K2XvjUnA1lQqPg4bu9Nf8N/story.html' title='' rel=''>here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a useful sidelight to this development: Without fiber connections to these shelters, they won’t be as effective. No fiber, no unlimited high-capacity WiFi. So basic city communications infrastructure will have to be up to snuff, an essential step for any responsive city.</p>\n<p>Now, the governance side. It matters — a lot — that Mayor Garcetti is interested in digital innovation in Los Angeles, and that he has a top-flight team with extensive experience in the private sector. This is still new; this whole change in cities and the hiring of Chief Data Officers is just happening now. (Brett Goldstein, of Chicago, was the very first — hired in 2011.) It matters that Los Angeles today <a href='http://la.curbed.com/archives/2015/08/los_angeles_mobility_plan_2035.php' title='' rel=''>cares about mobility</a> and not just cars</p>\n<p>It also matters that cities are interested in doing small-scale pilots to test digital projects. A decade ago, this wouldn’t have happened. Now, Los Angeles is willing to try something small, see what works, and adapt over time.</p>\n<p>So pay more attention to JCDecaux. Watch for their name and think about the company’s role in your public life. And next time you’re waiting for a bus, consider how much more the bus shelter could be doing for you. The traditional physical transit shelter could be a key platform for the development of new digital services in urban spaces — where most of us spend most of our time.</p>\n\n<p>Follow Backchannel: <a href='https://twitter.com/backchnnl' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Twitter</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671' title='' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</em></a></p>	2015-09-08 15:00:33.718759	2015-09-24 01:00:43.47706	<h2>These Two LA Bus Stops Might Change the Future of Cities</h2>\n<h4>Mayors are beginning to understand that citizens should have instant access to vital information — through…</h4>

She has big ideas and I have time to do some of the work. I am a teacher and it is summer vacation after all. My wife first thought that she wanted a “she-shed”. I had looked all over for plans and was almost ready to start building when she changed her mind. I was looking forward to building a shed, something I have never done before, but I took too long trying to find the perfect plans and directions. A few days ago she told me that she would like a pergola. She even sent me pictures of some of the ones she liked. This time I didn’t wait for the perfect storm of plans, directions and weather, I put the paint on the canvas.</p>\n        <figure>\n          <div>\n            <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*B4hgjjojtLk49JlfZepSwQ.jpeg' class='post-image'/>\n          </div>\n          <figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n<p>I have never taken lumber and turned it into something. I have wanted to but have been too scared and worried that whatever I built wouldn’t turn out the way I wanted. I decided that the only way I would ever know if I could build something was to build something. There were many trips to Home Depot and Lowe’s, I didn’t know how to plan a materials list, because I didn’t know exactly what I was doing. I am sure that a professional pergola builder would not have taken as long as I did to build the pergola. I am also sure that a builder would have done almost everything differently. I don’t care about that because I am proud of the finished product. It isn’t perfect but I built it and it is great!</p>\n<p>This project has fueled my risk taking tendencies. I started with a blank canvas and I put the paint on the canvas. If I never try anything new how will I grow and find out new areas I can be successful. As the new school year approaches, I will be thinking of things I have wanted to do with teachers and students but never tried. What is the worst that can happen? I will try something and it won’t work? That will give me a chance to try something else. I will never know if something will be successful if I don’t put the paint on the canvas.</p>\n<p>What are you going to try this fall?

Let’s explore five common myths and mistakes when it comes to getting educated, building a resume, landing a job, and starting off on the right foot in the professional world.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fallacy #1: You can’t turn down “free” opportunities</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Things too good to resist can be dangerous.</p>\n<p>So many young people suffer through stuff they don’t like with no clear future benefit just because everyone else calls it a great opportunity, or something they’d be crazy to turn down. “If you get in to an Ivy, you go!”, or “If Goldman offers you a job, you take it!”, or “If your parents will pay for this expensive education, you can’t walk away from that free experience!”</p>\n<p>But it’s not free. Every action has an opportunity cost — what other things you’re giving up in order to do it — and money is the least important. “Free” comes with strings attached, just like your parents money. Most unhappy young students and workers are unhappy because they feel like they can’t turn down something someone offered them. You can. In fact, you probably should.</p>\n<p>The more skin you have in the game, the more likely you are to succeed. Watch students who are paying their own way through a school or educational program. Watch people who pay to go to conferences or professional development trainings out of their own rather than their companies’ pockets. Consider books you buy for yourself vs. those gifted to you. Which do you get more out of?</p>\n<p>There’s a reason Bruce Wayne couldn’t climb out of the prison until he tried it without the rope. There’s a reason Vegas is better than experts at predicting sports outcomes. When you have something of your own to lose, you sharpen your focus and perform your best. <a href='http://www.discoverpraxis.com/blog/get-some-skin-in-the-game/' title='' rel=''>Place a bet on yourself</a>. Put yourself in positions where you stand to lose or gain based on your failure or success</p>\n<p>Don’t do things you don’t like doing just because they are “free”. It can tether you to the expectations of others and make you a worse decision maker. Make it a goal to become independent of the goodwill of others and dependent on your own success as soon as possible, even if that means turning down <a href='https://medium.com/on-breaking-the-mold/opportunities-that-98-of-people-should-take-but-you-shouldn-t-2a9419e9ce18' title='' rel=''>opportunities others would salivate over</a>. They don’t have to live your life. You do</p>\n<h3><strong>Fallacy #2: Your major matters</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>What you know matters. What you study in school? Not so much (with the exception of legally required majors for heavily regulated industries).</p>\n<p>All the most valuable things you’ll learn in life won’t come from a classroom. How to walk, talk, drive, use Google, navigate social situations, and creatively solve problems are learned by doing. The most important ideas you’ll deal with are more likely to come from your own experience, reading, and discussing than from assignments. You can’t outsource the development of knowledge to a department, program, or credential.</p>\n<p>Studies and majors won’t automatically grant you useful knowledge, nor will they provide a deep and rich network. We all need one. A pool of people with whom we’ve established social capital, and who we can work with and call on for resources, expertise, and support is indispensable. It’s not uncommon for a university experience to provide you with some friends and future associates, but never assume just being around a bunch of other students with similar interests is enough. That’s a recipe for building a horizontal network, not a vertical one. You need both.</p>\n<p>A network of people mostly the same age with mostly the same interests at mostly the same skill and experience level is a start, but only a very small start. You need to step outside the institutional setting and build a network that includes retired pros, middle-aged managers, young investors, old experts, and an array of people up and down the world of enterprise across a diverse set of industries.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fallacy #3: “Leadership” is a skill</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the real world product beats paper every time.</p>\n<p>I read a lot of resumes from people who clearly obsess over them. They are spattered with a diverse array of activities and list vague skills like “Leadership” and “Integrity.” These don’t indicate anything but an obsession with credentials and titles. You’ve got to demonstrate value creation.</p>\n<p><a href='http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/the_magic_of_ed.html' title='' rel=''>Resumes and degrees are signals</a>. Their only purpose is to let you broadcast that you pass some minimum bar of intelligence and ability. They can’t do much more, and increasingly, they don’t even do well at that minimum signal. Activities are not outcomes. Anyone can join a club or be named treasurer. Few can actually create value in a demonstrable way. The latter crushes the former every time</p>\n<p>Can you show something you’ve actually “shipped”? Do you have an easily verifiable reputation for getting stuff done? Show, don’t tell. <a href='http://www.nina4airbnb.com/' title='' rel=''>Show them the website you built</a>. Show them the number of new page likes your Facebook ad campaign generated. Let them see the customers you served, the money you raised, the newsletter you produced, or the app you launched</p>\n<p>Whether any of these tangible creations succeeded is far less important than whether you finished them. Everyone can sign up for stuff and spout about ideas. Everyone can pass a class. Very few can deliver results on time. Almost no one can conceive an idea and bring it to life without being forced to be some authority figure.</p>\n<p><a href='https://medium.com/life-learning/want-to-do-cool-stuff-build-a-better-signal-4a20f526122f' title='' rel=''>Focus less on the resume and more on the product.</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Fallacy #4: There is one right path</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href='https://medium.com/synapse/what-you-ll-be-doing-in-20-years-doesn-t-exist-yet-d4bad90f613' title='' rel=''>Most likely your future job doesn’t exist yet</a>. Don’t stress about it, this is a good thing</p>\n<p>It’s ridiculously painful to decide what your calling in life is, and what educational and career steps you must take to live it. Relax. There isn’t a single path that, if missed, will doom you forever. You’re traveling to a largely unknown destination. How can you plan for that? Simple: don’t try to do what you love. <a href='http://zakslayback.com/2014/09/15/dont-do-things-you-dont-like-doing/' title='' rel=''>Just try to avoid what you don’t</a></p>\n<p>Make a list of things you really don’t like, aren’t good at, and don’t even really want to be good at. Anything not on that list is fair game. Go try it. When you discover through experience more things you dislike, add them to the list. Pretty soon the field of viable options will begin to narrow. Any step within that field is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fallacy #5: You are an employee</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Machines and software are better employees than humans. So what?</p>\n<p>You’ve got one amazing advantage: humans are wonderfully creative and adaptive. Use it. You can’t afford the employee mindset, where you simply specialize, follow orders, and expect your company to do the heavy lifting when it comes to your financial support, happiness, and reputation. You are your own firm, wherever your paycheck may come from.</p>\n<p>You’ve got to think like an entrepreneur. Take ownership of the company vision, whether you created it or not. Understand that you’re not just laying bricks but building a cathedral. Ask questions. Look for ways to improve, even things outside of your department or direct control. Do one thing to add value to yourself and your company every single day.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean you should ever consider yourself too good for old fashioned grunt work. Ask any entrepreneur if they’ve ever done their own data entry or toilet scrubbing. They have. It does mean you have to adopt a big-picture mindset and don’t wait for assignments, but look for ways to create value. Whenever possible, just do them rather than asking permission.</p>\n<p>As the market changes demand for whatever specialized skills you have may grow or shrink. The <a href='http://www.discoverpraxis.com/blog/what-machines-and-software-cant-do/' title='' rel=''>one thing that will always be in demand</a> is creative problem solvers who think big and act swiftly</p>\n<h3>Shift your mindset. Break the mold.</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>What does combating all these myths have in common? You can’t wait around for other people to confer status, knowledge, or success on you. You’ve got to take the reins and build your own education and career, and it all begins with a mindset shift.</p>\n<p><a href='https://twitter.com/isaacmorehouse' title='' rel='nofollow'><em>Isaac Morehouse</a> has tried just about every form of education and has spent years building and running educational programs and mentoring students. Throughout his work in nonprofits, teaching, writing, and training, he’s seen diminishing returns from traditional education and career preparation models.

As you approach the 2015-16 school year and prepare to use <em>Eureka Math</em> in your classroom, whether this is your first year of implementation or your third, we suggest that you use this “exit ticket” approach to evaluate your successes and struggles, and plan for the next school year</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Reflect</strong></p>\n<p>Consider these questions as you reflect on your experience implementing the curriculum.</p>\n<li>How long did each module take?</li>\n<li>Did you try to teach every part of every lesson or did you customize to meet the needs of your students?</li>\n<li>What will you do differently next year?</li>\n<li>Will your students come to you needing less ‘gap filling’?</li>\n<li>Will they come to you with increased number sense?</li>\n<li>Will they come to you with an awareness of the models and strategies used within the modules?</li>\n<li>How will their prior learning affect their future learning?</li>\n<li>How will all of this affect the math instruction that will happen in your classroom next year?</li>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Collaborate</strong></p>\n<p>Connect with both your colleagues and other Eureka educators through online communities on <a href='https://www.facebook.com/eurekamathofficial' title='' rel=''>Facebook</a> and <a href='https://www.pinterest.com/eurekamath0130/' title='' rel=''>Pinterest</a>. Discuss with them the following</p>\n<li>What were you able to accomplish?</li>\n<li>What were some of the triumphs and the struggles of the year?</li>\n<li>What did you spend a great deal of time with and which concepts were you not able to get to?</li>\n<li>Which instructional strategies were successful and which ones would you adjust?</li>\n<li>Examine and share samples of student work to get a good understanding of the young mathematicians that left your classroom at the end of the year.</li>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Plan</strong></p>\n<p>Once you’ve reflected, communicated, and collaborated, look to this list of resources and suggestions to help you grow from your struggles and expand upon your successes.</p>\n<li>Look to the demands of the <a href='http://www.corestandards.org/Math/' title='' rel=''>CCSS</a> and reflect on the <a href='http://ime.math.arizona.edu/progressions/' title='' rel=''>Progressions Documents</a></li>\n<li>Look at the length of each module and the school calendar. Create a rough skeleton of when each module will be taught.</li>\n<li>Use the various resources available on the Great Minds <a href='http://greatminds.net/support' title='' rel=''>Support Page</a></li>\n<li>Reference the <a href='http://greatminds.net/maps/math/pacing-guides' title='' rel=''>Planning and Preparation Guides</a></li>\n<li>Check out the <a href='https://medium.com/eureka-math' title='' rel=''><em>Eureka Math</em> Blog</a></li>\n<li>While watching our <a href='http://greatminds.net/maps/teach-eureka/videos/grade-k' title='' rel=''>Teach Eureka Video Series</a> download and complete the <a href='http://greatminds.net/maps/documents/math/teach%20eureka-viewing%20guide.pdf' title='' rel=''>Teach Eureka Viewing Guide</a></li>\n<li>Seek out and study the sections entitled “Preparing to Teach a Module” and “Preparing to Teach a Lesson” which can be found within the Module Overview for Module 1 at each grade. Spend time planning with others.</li>\n<li>Dedicate time in your schedule to preview each module before it is taught and to give a forward vision of how each topic builds from previous topics and leads to future topics.</li>\n<p>As the ‘14-‘15 school-year came to a close, and you reflected back on your implementation of <em>Eureka Math</em>, did you find yourself thinking ‘How will I ever fit in all of the lessons/content by the end of the year?’ Were some of the modules left untouched or incomplete? Are you wondering what’s going to happen next year and what to do now? If so, you are not alone. Keep these three steps in mind so you’re not left wondering next year</p>\n<p><em>This post is by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mary-Jones-Eureka-Math-Grade-4-Writer/1557111431208353?fref=ts' title='' rel='nofollow'>Mary Jones</a>, a former teacher, who is a writer for the </em><a href='http://www.eureka-math.org' title='' rel='nofollow'>Eureka Math</a> A Story of Units <em>curriculum.</em></p>	2015-08-06 23:00:13.461434	2015-09-24 01:00:23.927181	<h4><strong>Strategy</strong></h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you’re familiar with the Eureka classroom, you know that at the end of each lesson every student is given an exit ticket to evaluate their level of understanding and inform the planning of subsequent lessons.
